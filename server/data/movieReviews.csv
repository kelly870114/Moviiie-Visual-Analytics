CASINO,"""Now it looks like Disney Land"""
CASINO,"I enjoyed this more than ""Goodfellas"". I generally avoid violent films...which is why I resisted watching ""Casino"" for a long time. However, despite being very violent in spots, the film turned out to be very compelling....it was far more than just violence and had an interesting look at the mob influence in Las Vegas back in the day.
The film is unusual in that it has two leading men with parallel stories. Sometimes Ace and Nicky (Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci) were in scenes together....often they were apart...each doing his own thing. As for Ace, he was a smart man who was in charge of one of Vegas' top casinos. He was tough...but basically honest for a mobster. As for Nicky, as you'd expect with a Joe Pesci character, he's a bit of a nut-job....often out of control and letting anger govern most of his decisions. Unlike Ace who had a veneer of honesty about him, Nicky was a hood...and didn't mind this. Eventually, the pair end up having a downfall. How and what happens to each you'll have to see for yourself.
The parts of this film I enjoyed the most were when you learned about how Vegas operated. Seeing Ace dealing with crooked gamblers was especially interesting. And, in this sense, I enjoyed the film much more than ""Goodfellas""...also with the same stars and same director. This is because ""Goodfellas"" was mostly just about violence and crime...whereas ""Casino"" seemed to have more story and wasn't always about excessive violence and nastiness...not that the film is in any way a 'nice' picture. It's filled with obscenities, nasty folks and a few scenes of horrific violence. Think about this before you decide whether or not to see the movie.
By the way, this is only a personal choice and doesn't really affect the movie much, but one thing I did not love about the film is the omnipresent pop music....which at times made the film seem like a music video. I think less of this would have been nice."
CASINO,I Know I Am In The Minority When I Say This Was Much Better Than Goodfellas.
CASINO,"The most uncompromising studio picture of the 1990s. A complex, multilayered, beautifully directed film, Martin Scorsese's Casino is a masterpiece of destruction and betrayal. Few films take so many chances and succeed so wonderfully. It takes some of the basic formulas that were found in Goodfellas and applies them to another type of story - while Goodfellas' view was ground-level, telling the story of the ""blue collar"" gangsters of NYC, this film tells the story of the guys who controlled those guys. And it's fascinating to watch these people run Las Vegas, control the flow of money, and then fall from the heights of power due to lust, hubris, and greed. An amazing film that will hopefully get the recognition it deserves in the years to come."
CASINO,"Robert De Niro, an icon of the contemporary Hollywood crime film... Based on a true story, Martin Scorsese ""Casino"" is a motion picture about two characters and their chance to rule the desert paradise of Las Vegas¬Ö We are introduced in with all the lights, the noise, the flashing and the colors of the town that doesn't sleep day or night¬Ö
De Niro's character, Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, is based on Frank ""Lefty"" Rosenthal, who was a hell of a handicapper¬Ö He was so good that whenever he bets, he could change the odds for every bookmaker in the country¬Ö Genius at what he was doing with numbers, he proved to a lot of guys in the Chicago Mob that he was a tremendous earner that he could make a lot of money for them¬Ö As a result, he was able to accomplish whatever bookmaking, handicapping, he wanted to do, with the umbrella of protection from those guys¬Ö 'Ace' runs the casino with an iron fist refusing any outside people cheating at his tables¬Ö
But he had a fatal flaw¬Ö 'Ace' always felt that he could logically and intelligently deal with things, even to deal with emotions¬Ö So he decides on making a life with a woman who, he knows, does not necessarily love him¬Ö Anyway with such a sexy wife and money to burn, 'Ace' was the epitome of opulence, confidence and power¬Ö
Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) was fascinating¬Ö Great woman, truly beautiful, one of the best-known hustlers in town¬Ö For her, a guy like 'Ace' was the ultimate score¬Ö So the way to Ginger's heart was clearly money¬Ö 'Ace' knew that but he didn't care¬ÖWhat he wanted was to marry her¬Ö
Sharon Stone really stood up to the challenge in her role as a casino hustler who is so wild¬Ö She was young, fresh, confident, looking absolutely fantastic as the independent woman whom everybody desires¬Ö
Joe Pesci succeeds in his scary tough role as the strong man who has nerve, and isn't afraid of the cops¬Ö He was reportedly a mob hit man reputed to be a sadistic killer¬Ö (In one scene, his character is shown torturing someone by putting his head in a vise.)
To protect his friend and adviser, Nicky (Pesci) would beat to a pulp any street guys who messed with 'Ace' or didn't give him the proper respect¬Ö Over the course of their friendship Nicky delivered a number of these messages always making sure that 'Ace' didn't get his hands dirty¬Ö 'Ace' witnessed several beatings on his behalf¬Ö Nicky's mission was to show his worth to the family as an enforcer¬Ö
The clothes on De Niro looked very straight, more dangerous and very threatening¬Ö They were very important cues to his character, and again, to the progression of the story¬Ö 'Ace' was an extremely fastidious guy¬Ö And, of course, as you follow the story he starts out in more conservative colors and as things become more chaotic, the colors become more chaotic"
CASINO,"Entertaining, but it lacks bite and emotion"
CASINO,"Typically fantastic Scorcese film I have to admit my bias, because I believe that Scorcese cannot do wrong - ever. Even his lesser-known or critically panned films are above the ""great film"" line, and Casino is certainly no exception.
Casino spans three decades and chronicles the true story of a faction of the mob who ran Las Vegas casinos. Robert DeNiro plays Ace Rothstein, a fantastic bookie who is chosen to run the Tangiers hotel and casino. Along the way, he marries a drug-addicted con-artist trophy wife (Sharon Stone) and struggles with his friendship with loose-cannon Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci). Rothstein is a complicated figure in that he is not a heavy, yet he wields a lot of power due to the respect he has gained from his mob bosses back home.
Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci are both fantastic in their roles, and Sharon Stone actually turned out a non-irritating performance. As the viewer, you can't stand her, but that is the point. Scorcese's normal supporting cast are also involved in this film, including his great mother - even though she usually has incredibly minimal roles, they are always memorable.
Scorcese seems to have several different directing styles, and Casino follows in the tradition of Goodfellas as a pseudo-documentary. A lot of the exposition is revealed by the characters themselves in the form of voice-overs, and several scenes are filmed in documentarian fashion. The entire production however, is sleek and very quick. The use of music bears mentioning as well: Most Martin Scorcese films have an amazing soundtrack that adds to and enhances the scene. Being a child of the MTV age, I'm a sucker for good uses of music in films and Scorcese is a master. Scorcese doesn't just utilize the soundtrack, he makes it part of the storytelling - by the music, we chronologically know what time period we are witnessing, since one cannot rely on other factors, such as fashion alone. One of my favorite scenes in film which effectively involves music is actually from Casino - the very intense scene when the relationship between DeNiro, Stone and Pesci come to a head in the climax of the film. The pounding music cut throughout this scene is a cover of ""Satisfaction"" by Devo and the result is absolutely brilliant.
Being a complete film geek, I generally don't go to films that feature certain stars, I go to films by certain directors and Scorcese is one of them. While this was probably the tenth time I'd seen this film there were more things I noticed, and I'm sure I'll notice more upon my eleventh viewing. The man is a complete genius, and a gift to film - my suggestion is to watch some of his films, then check out his unbelievable series, ""A Personal Journey with Martin Scorcese Through American Movies"" which was done the same year as Casino. The series is essentially a primer on the history of film, sectioned off by film genres. You not only will experience his amazing intellect and massive knowledge of film history, but his incredible humility as well.

CASINO,"Hugely underrated and very compelling film I don't consider Casino Scorsese's very best film(Goodfellas is my personal favourite), but it is a fantastic film and definitely one to see. It is shocking, disturbing and unflinching in places, particularly the part where a head gets squeezed in a vice, but that added to the atmosphere rather than distracted from it.
Casino is brilliantly made too. I loved the setting, the cinematography and editing are outstanding and never take away from the atmosphere, and Martin Scorsese's direction is superb. The realism the film has is always absorbing, the subplots that form the story are intriguing and the characters are adeptly drawn.
The story for me has seldom a dull moment, not with the subplots as intriguing as they are, how well made it is, how good the characters and acting are. The characters also are deliberately less endearing than are seen with Goodfellas, making it perhaps a more even portrayal of unorganised crime, but the decision to do that paid off. The acting is equally impressive. Robert DeNiro the great actor he is is incredibly charismatic, Joe Pesci gives his best performance in one of his more meatier roles and Sharon Stone(who has never been this good or even sexy before) is a revelation in a very demanding role.
Overall, hugely compelling and underrated. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
CASINO,"An underrated and undervalued Scorsese Classic If you haven't seen Casino yet, stop whatever it is you're doing, rush to the nearest video store, rent it, and watch it. Along with Mean Streets Casino is probably Scorsese's most underrated and unheralded picture. I would also venture to say that this is probably his most ambitious film. The film deals with a particular time period and a particular atmosphere and accomplishes an overwhelming achievement by creating and accurately portraying both. The art direction is splendid, most likely the best of any film Scorsese has ever done. The acting is superb. I never thought Pesci would be able to top his dynamic performance in Raging Bull until I saw Casino. Every time I watch this picture I fall in love with it all over again. This is the most honest depiction of Las Vegas, especially of the time period it was portrayed in. Scorsese's direction is flawless. Perhaps it is because I watch alot of Scorsese and Kubrick films, but I am becoming less satisfied with plot driven films and more enamored by films that possess the freedom that typical stories just don't seem to hold. Sharon Stone gives the best performance of her career, and as far as the editing is concerned, well if you believe like Kubrick and Pudovkin that a film is not shot, but built who better to have on your team than long time cohort, collaborator, and editor Thelma Schoonmaker. Ultimately, the genius of Scorsese is not just in the mastery of the medium, but in the understanding and appreciation for the necessity of great collaborators on all levels that Scorsese has consistently utilized throughout his career. Casino exemplifies not only the best of a Scorsese film, but transcends it. This film is truly a gem."
CASINO,"A Can't-Miss Story No Matter How Told As a lifelong gambler who has crossed paths with a few fringe types portrayed in the film, I'm well aware of the story, the culture, and the ambiance of the Tangiers, the fictional casino placed in the control of Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein (Robert Deniro). Rothstein is not a mob member, but a ""moneymaker"" for them because he's the nation's best sports handicapper. It was refreshing for a movie to finally show that not all gamblers are stupid, but instead one of those who takes advantage of the many who are.
Rothstein's partner in crime is Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), who is far less convincing as a mobster than he would seem to like to believe. Sharon Stone plays the psychotic Ginger, a once-in-a-lifetime role in that it was the only time in my life I could bear to watch her on film. The supporting cast is strong, led by James Woods and Don Rickles (excellent in his dramatic capacity), and the movie is generally well-acted.
If you are a gambler or know the ""wiseguy"" culture, the movie doesn't have to be explained, while if you aren't, you'll feel like you've stumbled upon the secret meeting place of the mafia and made privy to what is said, without anyone knowing you were there. This film is based on the true story of what happened when the mob tried to put its men in suits and have them heading a casino, and why it has never been tried since. The homage paid to the incestuous nature of Nevada politics was an excellent touch.
Most of us wouldn't like a guy like Sam Rothstein, nor would we like to be him, but if we go to Vegas for a weekend and stay at a casino/hotel, we'll have a better experience if his watchful eye is ensuring that our stay is a pleasant one. The film's nod to how Vegas has been sanitized since those days is also accurate, and reflects sadness at a lost era, where the baby (the ""old school"" types who made Vegas great) was thrown out with the bathwater (the organized crime influences)."
CASINO,"Scorsese ,Deniro &Pesci deliver again Casino has to be one of the most underrated films that Martin Scorsese directed in the nineties. The acting by the leads is good and the script is excellent. Robert Deniro gave an Oscar worthy performance and Joes Pesci is chilling yet funny again. Even Sharon Stone is good in this brilliant film"
CASINO,"How Others See Us Casino is my favorite movie of the last decade of the last century. Just like in Goodfellas, Martin Scorsese rivets the audience to their seats without a real hero to root for. It's the power of the characters he creates.
Robert DeNiro as the gambler boss of the Tangiers casino in Las Vegas of the 70s and 80s and Joe Pesci gangster are long time boyhood pals from the mean streets of Brooklyn. Both move out to Las Vegas seeking their respective places in their related fields at the orders of the higher ups in the criminal world. But circumstance drives them apart and one of those circumstances is Sharon Stone.
People descending into degradation is always a role that will get you noticed by the Academy. Sharon Stone's part as Ginger is no exception here. She's a high price call girl when we first meet her and her descent into drug addiction isn't pretty, but Scorsese keeps it very real.
But the main story line involves DeNiro and Pesci. To see ourselves as others see us is one elusive goal not attained by many in this world. These two aren't an exception. Each can see how the other is screwing up and absolutely cannot see what he's doing.
The key scene in the whole film is when DeNiro and Pesci meet in the desert where a lot of problems have been known to disappear. If you can get passed all the cursing which is how you would expect gangsters to talk, each is making very realistic assessments about the other one and neither is listening to a word the other is saying.
This is why I love Casino so much. I've never seen that particular theme ever handled so well on the screen."
CASINO,The perfect picture of Las Vegas early days.
CASINO,"Narrated for the Blind Fueled by mob bosses, two long-time friends make it big in Las Vegas. Scorsese not only rehashes the themes he explored in ""Goodfellas,"" but is also much too long-winded about it. After the film starts with heavily narrated expository scenes, one would expect the main story to kick in, but it continues in the same vein. This must be the most heavily narrated film in history, defying the notion that film is mainly a visual medium. Adding to the busy soundtrack is a non-stop hit parade of 1970s songs. Of course there are numerous scenes showcasing Scorsese's obsession with repulsive violence. De Niro and Pesci essentially reprise their ""Goodfellas"" roles. Stone is alluring."
CASINO,"Even though the technique is pure, the storytelling seems half-baked and uninterested in itself. The opening 30 minutes or so of ""Casino"" embodies everything that I adore about pre-21st century Martin Scorsese cinema, most particularly the excellent craftsmanship he seems to have lost his grip in on recent years. As the picture begins, we get this fabulous quasi-documentary narrative with Robert De Niro, as the film's protagonist‚Äînobody with any sense of morality can call a mob figure a hero‚Äîproviding us all the details. What he's been given to say is fascinating, and the way Scorsese coordinates his camera is superb. The technique is pure, the edits are crisp and clean (there are none of those horrendous, in-your-face jump cuts that stabbed his 2006 film ""The Departed"" clean through the heart), and the amount of detailed information presented in an entertaining way. Scorsese and his co-screenwriter, Nicolas Pileggi, both of whom collaborated on the 1990 gangster masterpiece ""GoodFellas,"" are certainly to be commended as researchers. In this fabulous first half-hour, they know just when and where to tell us data about how the mob ran a Las Vegas casino and when to show us. They tell us who watches who during a big gambling night, and show us, in splendid detail, how to get rid of a cardsharp by giving him a bogus heart attack.
Unfortunately, for me, once Sharon Stone, as a prostitute who sets the protagonist's heart aflame, enters the picture, everything begins to drag. This is not a negative reflection on Sharon Stone's performance. Not only is this her best piece of work that I'm aware of‚ÄîI personally do not think she's untalented as an actress‚Äîbut she gives the best performance of the entire movie. There isn't a bad performance, really, but she does dominate everybody else in ""Casino."" So it's not her acting that wears out the movie for me; it's the pretentious and uninteresting melodrama that follows in her tracks.
The pseudo-romantic dynamic between De Niro and Stone is, at heart, just an old-fashioned gangster-and-his-moll story, with the feisty woman first being pushed around, then pushing back, standing up to the boyfriend with the gun. Why does this dynamic go wrong? Because the screenplay tries to make something monumentally important out of it all. It tries to go deep, explore the psyches of both characters, takes them out of the casino and into the deserts and apartments of Las Vegas, and attempts to bring a psychologically fascinating angle to their relationship. Here, it completely falls apart, and the remaining two and a half hours of the movie‚Äîthe middle in particularly‚Äîreally begins to drag. The other problem with this relationship is that De Niro's character is not interesting when the movie tries to explore his depth as a person. He's much more interesting in the old-fashioned personality of the 'rough-and-touch, silent but deadly' casino manager who, save for his cameras, supervises everything that goes in his establishment. Once he gets all mucky and muggy with Stone, the fascination is wiped clean from the slate. As was my ability to stay interested.
I wish that ""Casino"" had stayed inside the casinos and not gone into the deserts, apartments, swamps, of outer Las Vegas. For me, the heart of the movie was contained in that big, luxurious building with the omnipresent colors. And I do not see why the movie could not have just stayed there and told its story from that setting, venturing outside only when necessary. Obviously, it's based on true events, but since the true events, as told on screen, become this dull, what's the point? Even Joe Pesci, essentially repeating his performance from ""GoodFellas,"" seems to have little purpose outside the casino. There's some promising sequences with him forcing De Niro to come down in the middle of the night to get him fifty million-dollar chips for a gambling rage, but, once again, once the story leaves the casino and starts getting involved with all the other stuff, it goes downhill.
But to the filmmakers' credit, having Pesci narrate part of the story does make his denouement all the more surprising. I will not give away exactly what happens, but the way things unfold toward the end, with Pesci's narration almost completely eradicating De Niro's, really does leave the audience unexpected for what eventually turns out. It's a brilliant touch.
I admired the physical production values of ""Casino"" as much as any great-looking movie I've ever seen, and Scorsese's flair as a director is very impressive. But even though the technique is pure, the storytelling seems half-baked and uninterested in itself. And that's the coldest feeling a movie can possibly give you. Whether it's representational or not, when you get the notion that the filmmaker lost interest in the story he was telling, it's all for nothing."
CASINO,"Very good but not without flaws Casino is a very good film. If you're at all interested in gangster/mafia films, or if you're at all a fan of director/co-writer Martin Scorsese, novelist/co-writer Nicholas Pileggi, or actors Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone or James Woods, then Casino is without a doubt a must-see. I'm a huge De Niro fan, and I'm a fan of Scorsese and Woods as well. I certainly enjoyed the film.
But I don't think that Casino is at all a ""perfect"" film. An 8 out of 10 may seem high, but if you're familiar with my reviews, you'll know that it's not that high of a score from me--it's closer to average from me. There are plenty of flaws here, and I'm going to spend some time pointing them out, particularly since the film receives so many 10's.
Casino is based on the story of Frank ""Lefty"" Rosenthal and the Stardust casino in Las Vegas. The Rosenthal character is here named Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein and is played by De Niro. The hotel became the Tangiers for the film. The mob backs Rothstein but has to set up a false front while Rothstein ""secretly"" runs the hotel, because of his gambling charges back East. He falls in love with and marries former hooker/call-girl and current Vegas hustler Ginger McKenna (Stone), who remains in love with her pimp, Lester Diamond (Woods). Meanwhile, mob strong-arm Nicky Santoro (Pesci) heads out to Vegas to protect Rothstein, but eventually ends up running his own rackets and trying to effectively take over the town. Casino is the story of the relationship and political problems that this cast of characters and a number of associates run into. It's roughly a gradual road to destruction for everyone involved.
The film is unusual in many ways. The most prominent oddity is that a large chunk of it is told via alternated narration from the two main characters, Rothstein and Santoro. The aim was probably to include a lot more of Pileggi's book, in a more literal way, than would have been possible through more conventional means. It's remarkable that the narration works as well as it does, especially because a lot of it is given a rapid-fire delivery. For at least the first 15 minutes, there is barely a pause in the narrational dialogue.
One of the reasons it works is because of the style that Scorsese uses to accompany it in the opening. He employs a lot of fast cuts while presenting very stylized, documentary-like footage. The opening feels as much like an entertaining behind-the-scenes look at how the typical casino works as it feels like a fictional film about gangsters.
Eventually, the film evolves from almost 100% narration to almost no narration (although the narration never completely leaves the film). This happens so subtly that one hardly notices. Scorsese's directorial style likewise evolves from the fast-cut documentary approach to something more conventional.
This is all well and good, but on the other hand, the gradual evolution can only happen because the film is so long--it clocks in just a couple minutes shy of 3 hours. That's a bit too long for the story being told. By at least the halfway point, it starts to feel a bit draggy. All the material is necessary to the story, but it could have been tightened up a lot more.
Another unusual aspect is the score/soundtrack, which consists primarily of pop hits from a wide time span--30 years or more. While I like the songs--I've owned the CD since it came out and I listen to it often enough--and the songs can help set the mood for some scenes, they become a bit too incessant and overbearing for the story after awhile. It begins to approach the dreaded ""mix tape"" mentality, where the songs are just there because the director wanted to share some bitchin' tunes that he likes a lot. A bit of ebb and flow with the music, and music better correlated to the drama, would have worked even better.
Presumably, Scorsese was shooting for something like a sensory assault, since that's what you get in Vegas. The visuals are filled with neon lights, flashy clothes (I love Rothstein's suits), flashy people and such. The soundtrack is probably meant to match. But in that case, if I were directing, I think I would have went for a combination of commissioned music that incorporated a lot of casino sounds, or that mimicked a lot of casino sounds--the cacophonous electronic symphony of various machines constantly going through their modes--with schmaltzy show tunes, ala Liza, Jerry Vale, Tom Jones, Wayne Newton, etc.
That Scorsese was trying to give a Vegas-styled sensory assault is also supported by the audio-visual contrast between the Vegas scenes and the scenes in other locations, such as Kansas City. So I can understand the motivation, but I'm not sure the final result exactly worked.
Of course the performances are exceptional, even if everyone is playing to type, except for maybe Woods. The plot and characters are written and performed so that the viewer can see the disasters coming way before the characters can--and that's how it should be. For example, as a viewer, you know as soon as it starts that it's a bad idea for Rothstein to kowtow to McKenna to win her hand in marriage, but Rothstein is blind in love and he ends up paying for it. Everything unfolds almost a bit predictably in this respect, and another slight flaw is that we're shown the penultimate moment of the film right at the very beginning. It tends to make it feel even more stretched out, as you keep anticipating that scene.
But the slight flaws shouldn't stop anyone from seeing this film, and of course, quite a few viewers feel that there are no flaws at all."
CASINO,"7-7-7-7 Nothing you haven't seen before, Robert De Niro performs in a similar style to several he established his career playing and Joe Pesci can only play himself no matter what the role calls for. If organised crime capers are your thing, or you're a casino denizen, it's lucky 7s all round for you, although, on this occasion, it's complemented and elevated through an outstanding performance by Sharon Stone. She steals the picture as the addicted to anything femme fatale opportunist most men would aspire to tame and, if they did get that chance, they would soon discover the trophy wife from hell - Sam did, but don't let that put you off."
CASINO,"The Scorsese spell... During its first forty minutes, Martin Scorsese's ""Casino"" is pure narration, except for little spoken moments. It's a risky move, but then Marty has always been risky, and this movie may be the ultimate example to prove it. Closing in at three hours duration time, it takes its characters on a roller-coaster ride that not everyone might appreciate; from the advantages of recurrent fortune to the regular Scorsese tragedy.That's cutting it short, because there's a lot in the middle, but without telling you 'what' exactly goes on in ""Casino"", I'll tell you how you can approach it as a film.
When Sam Rothstein (Robert De Niro) is put in charge of the Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas, he sees it as the perfect chance to erase the obscure past we call carry with us. However, his best friend Nicky (Joe Pesci) is not fond of legitimacy; and when he settles in Vegas to protect him, it's not long until he starts doing some business of his own.
As Nicky himself puts it: ""The dollar¬ÖAlways the dollar"". But if we go back, Nicky also expresses at the beginning: ""It was perfect. Sam was the perfect guy to run the casino and he had me, his best friend, and Ginger, the woman he loved"". We see Ginger (a monumental Sharon Stone) at first as Sam sees her, a light in the middle of the room (there's one scene where this translates literally in images, with Robert Richardson's cinematography-that contains a wonderful use of light-putting the rest of the room in a mild darkness, while De Niro stands in awe as Stone walks and works the room accompanied by a constant light), but she is actually the most complex character of the film.
If you approach ""Casino"" as a movie to see the inside movement of the casino business and its ups and downs (a subject the film manages perfectly), you may not notice the complexity of Stone's character and her performance. But then, if you view the film as the study of the consequences of an arranged marriage and life, you might miss the best element of the film: Joe Pesci's creation of Nicky; something that's indeed better than his work in ""Goodfellas"".
Ultimately, you may choose to take ""Casino"" as the story of a long-time friendship and the betrayals that come with the years because people change and want different things from life. Again, this (as the marriage thing) is a subject that the film dominates. That's how brilliant Nicholas Pilleggi's-together with Scorsese-adaptation of his own book is; it covers everything with every detail. They did the same thing with ""Goodfellas"" and it was so rich that you could get lost in the 'mafia' universe.
Here, as in ""Goodfelas"" (both film share many similarities, more than anything in the ongoing decay of certain characters and images that seem obvious copies from the 1990 film and speak by themselves, about how great both movies are and that these similarities don't change that fact at all), you have to try to follow every plot line in order to witness every scene exactly as what it means in the movie.
It's the only way you'll enjoy the many conversations between Sam and Nick that lie between the best of the film and, besides showing that De Niro is the best when it comes to calming someone down and/or persuading him to make another decision; but Pesci is better because his stubbornness allows him to evade discussions and therefore cause the other more trouble (also that both know each other by heart so the work together is pure pleasure), are crucial to its development.
The narration comes and goes during the film, in present or past time, generating more confusion for the viewer. This is all after the first hour and a half, and if you're not hypnotized by the film's spell at that point, something must be wrong. Is the movie too long? Yes, if the spell didn't work on you; but if you're already connected with the characters and don't want to get out, it makes no difference if it lasts three or five hours."
CASINO,Is it just me...
CASINO,"A captivating and brilliant movie with an all star cast that I still cherish to this day. I still remember watching Casino as a 12 year old on New Year's Day back in 1997 and being captivated from start to finish. I was lucky to be watching Casino at that age considering that the film is rated R 18+ in Australia for Medium Level Violence and Medium Level Coarse Language. Thankfully my Dad was lenient as long as we were sensible as myself, my Dad and my brother sat together and watched the movie. Casino was and still is a brilliant movie. Martin Scorsese directed another top notch film. The all star cast was perfect. Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese mark another collaboration after their success with the classics Mean Streets (1973), Taxi Driver (1976), New York, New York (1977), The King of Comedy (1983), and Cape Fear (1991). Also joining in the collaboration is Joe Pesci of whom the three actors united for Raging Bull (1980), Goodfellas (1990) and The Irishman (2019).
Set in Las Vegas during the 1970's, Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein (Robert De Niro in another brilliant role) is in charge of the mafia connected Tangiers Casino to oversee its day to day operations. Sam is successful in turning the casino into a legitimate profitable venture as well as skimming some of the profits to the mafia. His legitimate lifestyle is put in jeopardy after he marries former hustler and prostitute Ginger (Sharon Stone in an Academy Award nominated performance) who turns out to be unstable and dishonest as she leads a self destructive lifestyle with alcohol and drugs as Sam continues to shower her with diamonds, fur coats, money and other expensive gifts along with access to a safety disposit box. Another huge threat in Sam's life is Chicago mafia enforcer and childhood friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci in another terrific performance) whose volatile behaviour earns him a ban from every casino in Las Vegas as he forms a crew and commits various crimes including robbery and burglary as well as beating, threatening and killing people. Nicky's actions bring a lot of unwanted attention to Sam due to their lifelong friendship. Ginger continues to see her ex boyfriend Lester Diamond (James Woods) who is a pimp and con artist yet is nothing more than a loser who is always asking Ginger for money. Though Sam organises to have Lester beaten up as a warning to stay away from his wife, Lester still pops up and continues to act as a leach. Marrying Ginger and bringing Nicky to Las Vegas would turn out to be Sam's downfall.
The all star cast also includes Kevin Pollak, L. Q. Jones, Dick Smithers and the late actors Don Rickles, Frank Vincent, and Alan King.
Director Martin Scorsese as always does an amazing job as he brought to life a classic movie based on Nicholas Pileggi's nonfiction novel Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas.
Casino is an extremely violent movie with several scenes that are quite unsettling and not for the faint hearted. The ""f"" is used 422 times throughout the whole movie.
I loved Casino when I first saw it and to this day, it deserves a spot as one of my top 10 movies of all time. It is 178 minutes long, but is a movie that I still cherish.
A well deserved 10/10."
CASINO,"Another Scorsese classic While re-watching ""Casino"" just now I kept thinking of Spielberg's words re: Kubrick. ""Just try to stop watching one of Stanley's movies when you've already started,"" he said. ""It's impossible"".
Perhaps, with Kubrick's passing, Scorsese became the greatest filmmaker on the planet. ""Casino"" is just an unbridled jolt of cinema, a three hour movie that feels like an hour and a half, a breakneck pace that still allows for rare depth in its performances and characterisations. It's the best performance Sharon Stone ever put in; after the ridiculous ""Basic Instinct"" and ""Sliver"", they could have written her off if not for this. Her character's arc is tremendous.
More than anything, ""Casino"" is a showcase of what Pauline Kael called ""film sense"", that implacable quality that all great directors have. Like Spielberg and Kubrick, Scorsese has a gift for knowing exactly what shot should follow which, is an absolute master of camera movements, angles, framing such that the movie streaks across the screen like fast-moving water over rocks, never once stalling or slowing down.
It's brilliant, but it's not up with the director's greatest work like ""Taxi Driver"", ""Raging Bull"", or ""Hugo"", which is a truly underrated masterpiece. It's a notch below, but when Scorsese is a notch below his best, he's still streets ahead of everybody else."
CASINO,"Bloated, but there's some good mob stuff here It's not ""Goodfellas"", but there are stretches when ""Casino"" is pretty great. That back-and-forth narration between De Niro and Pesci is a brilliant narrative trick and plays like a guided tour through this lavish empire the mob has carved out in Las Vegas (this, in spite of the town's gaudy trappings). Seductive, to say the least.
It's in the second half that the narration vanishes and the movie starts to overstay its welcome. This criminal enterprising dream can't last forever, and when things start to come crashing down, they do so viciously (don't ever tell Scorsese he's timid on his violence). It's mostly when the '70s give way to the '80s and Sharon Stone's drama takes center stage that things become sour. ""Boogie Nights"" sprang to mind around this time, although that was a much more satisfying story.
6/10"
CASINO,"Ossessione A reprise of Goodfellas, mostly, as has been pointed out, and although long, not as tired or boring as some have felt. How could a movie with Steve Allen and Jerry Vale be all bad?
People have wondered why Scorcese and Coppola keep coming back to mobsters, specifically the Mafia, and all that corruption mixed with loyalty. Of course no one knows, perhaps not even the directors.
But I suspect there are at least three reasons: First, it works economically. It draws the audience in. There is power and violence and sex to appeal to the men's fantasies. There is loyalty, intrigue, sheltered family lives, and the excitement of a wealthy rogue male for women.
Second, Italian-Americans may return repeatedly to stories of the Mafia for the same reason that Southern writers deal over and over with themes of minority relations. In spelling out the stories, they are explaining the odd customs of their subcultures to the rest of us. Yes, we are hung up on these obsessions, just as you believe, and here is how things work -- a bit more subtle than you'd thought, aren't they?
Finally, in exploring these themes in the interests of the outsider's better understanding of them, they can explore their own conflicts in model form, as stated in the anthropologist John M. Roberts' conflict-enculturation hypothesis. When we view something with ambivalence we tend to poke around in it, to touch it, fascinated by it. If we can't actually DO the thing itself -- become a mobster, endorse slavery -- we can play games with the idea, constructing little mock worlds in which we can jiggle the concepts around. In conflict about having children? Well -- you don't really need to. You can nurture something that is a model or surrogate child. Cats and dogs will do fine. But if your conflict is more intense, you are driven to less recognizable models. House plants, say. And if the conflict is VERY intense, you can start a coin or a stamp collection. What, after all, do you do with a stamp collection? You conceive of the idea, you start it when it's small, you feed it, you watch it grow and get bigger, and when it gets too big, or when you lost interest, you sell it on eBay and it moves out of the house. Directing a movie means constructing a model world too, like the model social world of a chess game.
In a movie, you lay out a plot, cause the characters to do certain forbidden things, and imagine how you might feel if you were doing them yourself. I'm not surprised that Scorcese made this movie, or that he's filled it with Italian-American actors. I'm not surprised that Faulkner wrote Intruder in the Dust, or that Judith Rossner wrote Looking for Mr. Goodbar, or that Philip Roth wrote Portnoy's Complaint. These model worlds they've created deal with issues like crime, race, female sexuality, and ethnic loyalties that have kept Italian-Americans and Southerners and feminists and Jews marginal to the rest of our culture. The artists are trying to explain to us and to themselves how things look from the inside. If these issues ever disappear, which is most improbable, the conflicts will ease, marginal populations will no longer be prompted to produce such intense work, and the rest of us will be poorer for it.
Maybe in this case Scorsese did too good a job of it. I found myself listening to DeNiro's voice-over telling us that the James Woods character was a ""scumbag"" because he was a small-time chiseler chasing dentists on the golf course, taking money from the whore Sharon Stone. But who is DeNiro's character to make such judgments? Woods is detestable because he's a vellicating minor hood with no money? Whereas DeNiro is morally superior because he's a major player with LOTS of illegal gains? We admire DeNiro because he is the more successful crook. The moral calculus is a little confusing.
On top of all that highbrow stuff -- man, does Scorsese know how to stage a fierce family fight. I should know. And that opening scene -- a car explosion backed by the majestic sweep of Bach's Missa Solemnis!"
CASINO,"GoodFellas in Vegas...it was better in New York Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci team up again for a GoodFellas rehash. Casino is not a bad film. But it pales in comparison to what has come before it. It would be much easier to applaud Casino if we could take it on its own merits. But the parallels to GoodFellas are so numerous and so obvious, Casino always leaves us wanting more. We've seen this all before and we've seen it done better.
Casino starts quite literally with a bang with a rather shocking car bombing before the opening titles have even rolled. It's a fascinating and highly intriguing opening but Casino never is able to sustain that energy. The film slogs along for three hours with the pace so slow that at times the movie seems to come to a dead stop. Scorsese has, even in his most brilliant successes, been criticized for the pacing (or lack thereof) in his films. Casino is a prime example of a Scorsese film that would have benefited greatly if the action could have been pushed along just a little bit faster. There's a terrific story here, top-notch acting performances and the typically brilliant Scorsese visual touches. What's missing is the energy a film like GoodFellas had. For all that Casino has going for it, in the end it's simply not entertaining enough.
After the shock of the opening sequence, Casino goes back in time ten years to tell the story of Ace Rothstein, as played by Robert De Niro. We see he is running, on behalf of Midwestern mob bosses, the Tangiers casino in Las Vegas. Through use of voice-over narration (a la Goodfellas) Rothstein, and later Joe Pesci's Nicky Santoro, explain how the money moves through the casino and into the hands of the mafia kingpins. As the story begins everybody's getting paid, everything's running smoothly, everybody's happy. When mafia tough guy Santoro, played wonderfully by Pesci who could do this type of thing in his sleep, takes up residence in Vegas things start to unravel. Santoro's a hothead, out to make a quick buck for himself. Where Rothstein had been free to operate his casino in peace, when Santoro starts stirring things up he brings unwanted attention from the authorities. Rothstein's wife, Ginger, is not helping matters by being constantly drunk, stoned or drunk and stoned. Sharon Stone plays Ginger and the character is such a train wreck it's hard to really evaluate Stone's performance. She's certainly convincing as a glamorous call girl early on, perhaps less convincing when she's forced to be hysterically screaming all the time.
Anyhow, Ace ends up having problems with the wife, problems with the authorities and problems with his onetime good friend Nicky. It's fascinating to see all the conflict swirl around him and De Niro is reliably brilliant in his performance as he deals with all the madness around him. Pesci is terrific and Stone is OK. Actors playing smaller roles also do noteworthy work. James Woods does well in a bit part as a man who is part of Ginger's past. Frank Vincent (GoodFellas parallel number 8,362 or thereabouts) settles into his mobster's role quite easily. And Don Rickles and Dick Smothers of all people have serious parts to play and each does a fine job. So, the acting certainly isn't the problem. The main characters, and some of the secondary ones, are wonderfully developed. Casino is beautifully photographed as you would expect from Scorsese. And the story is a good one, intriguing from beginning to end. It's in that long journey from beginning to end where Casino stumbles somewhat. It just takes too long to get where we're going and the film can't sustain the energy it opened with. A fascinating story, but in the end one that with a better pace could have been told in a much more entertaining way."
CASINO,"Very Good, not great Taken alone, this was an excellent movie, very watchable, if a bit long. However, a lot of this movie obviously plays very close to what some of the people involved in it have played before. De Niro's character is eerily similar to Al Pacino's in ""The Godfather II"", and Joe Pesci could easily be playing himself in ""Goodfellas"". This is another solid effort from Scorcese and crew, but it lacks originality.
There were some interesting points. Sharon Stone was excellent, but once again, she seems to remind me of Talia Shire's Connie in ""The Godfather"". The same could be said of James Woods, who plays a Fredo-like scumbag (maybe Fredo wasn't that bad, but still....). To top it all off, we've got De Niro AND Pesci doing Ray Liotta's over-voice shtick from ""Goodfellas"".
All in all, I would recommend this movie, but I'd also recommend you see the other movies I've mentioned here first. The acting here is good, the plot isn't lacking, the only negative side is that it does get a little violent. All the same, if you're familiar with Scorcese's work, at times you feel like this movie is basically Henry Hill narrating the Corleone family history. It's hard to see this group be so good without quite reaching the greatness they've achieved in the past."
JOKER,I would not call it a masterpiece as some did
JOKER,"Not a spoon feeding of CGI fueled faux drama. The movie affects you in a way that makes it physically painful to experience, but in a good way."
JOKER,"Is it great? I don't know. When I heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10's, I was quite hyped and excited for this movie. When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.
Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.
Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.
Film of the year? Nope."
JOKER,"Perfect in every aspect. Truly a masterpiece, The Best Hollywood film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And truly the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife. Remarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting. Some people are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, but it's a necessity and message. It's about society and reflects those underappreciated/unrecognized/bullied people, proving they can do something too. The way it shows class difference, corruption and how rich and talented rule others around them is not exaggerated and that's what makes it different. It's BELIEVABLE. There could be multiple JOKERs living in our society that could shake those around them in much bitter way than the film shows making people uncomforting people. Consider this a wake up call, a message, but first a film. A PERFECT film."
JOKER,"A psychological study, rather than a superhero flick I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.
Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.
It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least. It's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.
Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).
I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing."
JOKER,"Went for a second time to watch I get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness. But come on that is not the point and it will never be. Enjoy this masterpiece because Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips overdid themselves with this movie . The acting,music and cinematography are just amazing ! Please enjoy the movie without overthinking it."
JOKER,"JUST AMAZING. How does this movie exist. Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director"
JOKER,"Outstanding movie with a haunting performance and best character development ever seen Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.
this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen."
JOKER,"Only certain people can relate This is a movie that only those who have felt alone and isolated can truly relate to it. You understand the motive and you feel sorry for the character. A lot of people will see this movie and think that it encourages violence. But truly, this movie should encourage each and every one of us to become a better person, treat everyone with respect and make each other feel like they belong in this world, instead of making them feel isolated."
JOKER,"Worthy Acting Performance By Phoenix Worth a Watch, but This Joker is Not Smart Enough to Become the Joker We've Come to Know"
JOKER,"Joaquin 'OSCAR', Joker = best Dark suspense thriller ... Darker than dark Knight. It's sad that Joaquin missed Oscar for 'The gladiator' as he was very compelling Villain. But I am quite confident he will win it for the 'Joker'. Damn what a movie !!! Keeps u on the toes all the time. Unpredictable storyline and really a deep interesting plot. Did I forget to mention acting ? Damn Do niro and Joaquin teach u what really is 5 star acting. To enjoy this movie, get a wine in your hand, close the curtains, turn of ur cellphones and put do not disturb sign on ur door. Best Dark thriller suspense movie you will get to experience."
JOKER,"OMG - Am I getting old or are people getting more stupid I was so hyped up to see this movie, loved the trailer, only movie I have wanted to watch in the cinema for a very long time.
I watched it and was bored. the aesthetics were amazing, music was good, story and execution was meh. the performance of the joker was a good performance but people raving about this are driving me mad. either you have not seen many movies or I have seen too many.
this movie was bang average and was actually boring. I was actually thinking about leaving half way through as I was bored out of my mind.
I do not regret watching it but it is being so overhyped that I am so confused right now. I think it had a good premise but could have been so much more, so much more.
Signs of a great movie is the repeat viewing of it or it moving you, joker did not move me whatsoever and I would not watch it again.
I thought maybe people are getting paid to write good review but have actually met people who think it is the best movie ever.... OMGGG
This movie is bang average and way overhyped.
phoenix performance is good but as the story and execution is so bad, I feel he never even touched the higher spectrum of performance he could have with the character.
I have experienced and seen worse in my life, if this made you feel, you are (i hate this word but have to use it) a snowflake. Please get off social media and live life.
there is a real world out there."
JOKER,"Yikes. THIS is people's ""best movie ever""?"
JOKER,"Acting Cannot Save Mediocre Script They say it's all in the writing. And this is a great example of that. Good acting and production values cannot save a script steeped in tiresome stereotypes and a failure to delve into a character's identity. We meet the Joker when already imbalanced and his so-called descent into madness is really a couple weeks away; far from a descent, it's a stroll. This is not a character study, despite claims to the contrary. It's a showcase of a good actor overly contorting his body and laughing manically as a mistaken expression of madness. Where is the past? Where are the influences? Where are the conflicts? What are the seminal moments that create the spiral? Perhaps if he had really had that relationship, and had it gone sour, it would justify a descent. Instead, it's a fait accompli. This is lazy writing, focused more on fancy long shots of Joaquin Phoenix dancing crazily than producing something of value to the franchise."
JOKER,"MASTERPIECE üòç Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime"
JOKER,"Joker > Endgame Need I say more? Everything about this Movie is Masterful in every single way! Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways."
JOKER,"It's About a Man While I've watched many of the superhero movies that have come down the pike, they are often the same. So the compensation for sensational plots involves great special effects and non-stop action. They are fun and I don't mean to dis them. What is missing is a truly psychological drama. We don't get into the heads of the characters. This film is incredible as we watch a man confront his demons. We see him made fun of, attacked, and beaten. When he responds, he is seen as crazy. He also find that he is diminished in the eye of a counselor, and his mother has kept a secret. I thought it gave us a foundation for the Batman mythos without getting to deeply into it. Acting, atmosphere, and a sophisticated plot makes this a really excellent film."
JOKER,"The Hype is real Most of the time movies are anticipated like this they end up falling short, way short. Joker is the first time I was more than happy with the hype. Please ignore the complaints of ""pernicious violence"" as they are embarrassing to say the least. We haven't seen a comic movie this real before. If we ever ""deserved"" a better class of criminal - Phillips and Phoenix have delivered. This is dark, Joker IS dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should. The bad guys are always more romantic anyway."
JOKER,Venice 76 review
JOKER,"""That's Life."""
JOKER,Well filmed but empty
JOKER,"Between a 7 and an 8 I thought this film was good but I just don't get the hype personally. The acting was amazing and the film was good overall but I think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point."
JOKER,"Good lord The acting, cinematography, sound design, and the script itself is phenomenal. This movie is a triumph. Joaquin Pheonix deserves an Oscar win for this tbh."
JOKER,"Kind of a letdown.... The reviews here are making this film out to be far better than it actually is. Don't get me wrong, technically, it is extremely well done and Phoenix's performance is really quite extraordinary (he is definitely looking at an Oscar nomination), but despite excellent writing, acting and direction....
....the film is kinda boring.
It had its moments, and, sure, it has some very disturbing elements but....If I had a watch, I would have looked at it many times as what this film lacks is...excitement.
The final act is most excellent, but it felt like it took forever to get to it."
JOKER,Extremely overrated
SLEEPERS,Really good and full of powerful performances - underrated if a bit flawed overall
SLEEPERS,Good
SLEEPERS,The Sleeper of 1996
SLEEPERS,"Hell's Kitchen's legacy A classic. The story is complex and very sophisticated. The cast is sheer brilliant and hardly to surpass. Here we get first-class entertainment in combination with suspense and a variety of themes that are fairly well known to anyone, just as revenge, justice, murder, abuse, atonement etc. The kids do a fine job, really. They add tremendous depth to the deeds and to the behave of the grown ups. Their genuine and sure-handed performances grant the movie a considerable amount of emotional recognition and chain anyone who soaks up and identifies with the storyline and the characters. The very end closes the circle and makes us aware of how quickly our lives can fall apart. Thrilling and suspense is guaranteed. Very recommendable."
SLEEPERS,"Excellent I really liked this movie. Great acting, great direction, great plot!
As another reviewer pointed out, the movie indeed has 3 parts. before,at and after the correction center. All three parts are equaly gripping. Except that the part in the correction center is very dark and disturbing.
Brad Pitt shines in a small role he has. So does Jason Patrick. Hoffman has his ususal confused charisma. Rest of the supporting cast is excellent too. Especially the denizens of hell's kitchen. Kevin Bacon looks realy menacing. But the person who realy shows his caliber again is de niro. He has one of these rare ""non-swearing"" roles of his. There is a scene where Jason Patric tells the story of the abuses they faced, and the camera focusses on Robert De Niro's face. Only thing changes is his eyes, from sharp and focussed at the first, you see them widening and then you see some trace of tears. Great! This scence reminds me of Omar Shariff standing on a balcony while soldiers start mayhem on the streets, in Dr. Zhivago.
A good care has been taken in getting child stars and adult stars look pretty similar.
Only thing li'll bit out of the place is constant referance to Count of montecristo. The revenge in the book is ""sweet lasting revenge"" where in this movie its straight shot. But heck! this is real life!
the last night the friends spend together is also really touching.
my rating 9/10."
SLEEPERS,Last third makes it worthwhile
SLEEPERS,"Visceral Vigilante Vengeance... If you're able to to turn a blind eye to the implausibility of the end, or instead see it as an interpretation of the lengths people will to go to for justice when the system has let them down then, coupled with the very realistic and believable earlier parts of the story, you have a very sad but not uncommon tale centred on abuse, with outstanding performances all round and a genuine reason to take a blood pressure pill to calm yourself down."
SLEEPERS,"SPOILER ALERT! Very good film, BUT...."
SLEEPERS,"A mixed bag The first half of the film is really strong and the scene that serves as the transition to the second half (the bar scene) is fantastic. I felt that the the latter half as a whole was a bit of a bubble though: there is a lot of The Count of Monte Cristo (the book that is referenced in the film a lot, check it out if you haven't) -esque revenge build-up but the payoff is a disappointment. For me, there were also slight pacing issues towards the end, along with some tonal choices I wasn't a fan of. Still, I'd say it's a fairly recommendable drama.
Rating: 6/10"
SLEEPERS,"An Interesting Film... Legedndary Filmmaker Barry Levinson's 'Sleepers' is An Interesting Film to watch. Based on Lorenzo Carcaterra's 1995 novel of the same name, this legal drama comes in-tact with skilled direction & proficient performances to lead it's narrative.
After a prank goes disastrously wrong, a group of boys are sent to a detention center where they are brutalized, physically & mentally. Over 10 years later, they get their chance for revenge.
Barry Levinson's Adpated Screenplay is Convincing. The film has interesting & absorbing moments in the first hour as well as in the second hour. However, the film gets too intense at times, and the faint-hearted are sure to shy away from those portions. Also, the film is very long. It definitely could've been trimmed. Levinson's direction is skilled. Michael Ballhaus's Cinematography is good. Editing is okay. Music by John Williams is impressive.
Performance-Wise: Kevin Bacon is effective as the bad guy. Dustin Hoffman is first-rate, while Bobby De Niro delivers a subdued performance. Brad Pitt is extremely natural. Jason Patric does well. Minnie Driver leaves a mark. Brad Renfro is passable. Others lend good support.
On the whole, 'Sleepers' is worth a watch, as it succeeds by holding your attention almost throughout. Thumbs Up!"
SLEEPERS,"Overlooked perfection A well-adapted, epic story of the childhood innocence of four boys brutally snatched away, and the subsequent revenge that took place so many years later. Perfectly paced, it is a long film whose length is never an issue; exciting courtroom drama, realistic sense of time and place, gritty yet sleek cinematography, and convincing performances from a cast that is actually to die for: Jason Patrick, Billy Crudup (""Big Fish"") Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro, Kevin Bacon, Minnie Driver and Brad Pitt in the same movie; it is a rare lineup. This is not to mention the young leads, who are completely convincing in heavyweight roles.
Leading the pack was Brad Renfro, whose passing in the same month as Heath Ledger was unfortunately nowhere near as noteworthy, and sadly is still a shock, for some, to learn of! If one is to go back and watch not only this film, but ""The Client"", ""Apt Pupil"" and the indie hit ""Ghost World"", one can see another talent that was perhaps not as widely recognised as that of Ledger, but just as unfairly snubbed short, and just as worthy of our recognition.
Barry Levinson puts together a film here that could easily be mistaken for a Scorsese work, and that may be the only criticism, if it is even that! Well drawn characters, electrifying, often emotional drama, the story never in a rush but never feeling laborious, this is an overlooked work of perfection."
SLEEPERS,Interesting but uneven
SLEEPERS,"All star cast does not disappoint This is one of the only films that I can watch time after time and still be highly entertained. The film has many layers and a great cast of fantastic actors. It also has a wealth of superbly drawn minor characters. Bruno Krby is excellent as always as Shakes' dad. A man apparently typical of the community in Hells Kitchen. Proud but ruling his wife in particular with a iron fist. He is portrayed far more favourably than in the book where it is clear he is a lousy father and husband. But it is the ever excellent Kevin Bacon who threatens to steal the show as the deeply disturbing Sean Nokes. He is pivotal to the 4 boys descent in to hell and his evil in the bar scene where he meets his demise sets the wheels in motion for the revenge in the 3rd part of the movie. De Niro is superb as always but has great support in Brad Pitt, Jason Patric, Minnie Driver and Dustin Hoffman. A Must see if you like films of this genre."
SLEEPERS,Sleepers
SLEEPERS,"Half-awake Levinson's Sleepers is a conventional but well-structured thriller, with the confidence to tell its story in three separate chapters, letting each element stand unhysterically on its own: it works as a story, not just as a plot. It even attempts a subtle ending, but somehow there's no real kick at the end. The problem here is the dignified integrity with which the film invests its heroes, something often seen in cinema but rarely in the messiness of real life. The accused in trial are both victims and murderers; but the film plays down the second element, and thereby squanders the inherent ambiguity of the scenario. As the darkness of the ""good guys"" is allowed to pass unnoticed, they fail to accumulate sufficient weight of character to make the ending count. Highly watchable, but it doesn't quite add up to the sum of its parts."
SLEEPERS,"Outstanding This movie is one of the best movies made in a long time. Previous comments seem to focus more on whether or not the story is true and seem to forget the phenomenal story. Who cares if the story is true or not? If it is, it only makes the movie that much more disturbing and heart-breaking. What is the big deal if it is or isn't true? It is still an amazing movie with a great story. Most so-called ""classics"" are not based on true stories, so what makes this movie any different? OK, now that I have said my peace about my feelings about the authenticity of the story, I can now comment on the actual movie. I can not say enough positive things about the movie. The actors are perfectly casted. I think every single one of them do an outstanding job in their portrayal. The story is heart-wrenching and it does an excellent job of getting its point across without showing or saying too much. This movie deserves more than it got."
SLEEPERS,"""I hear words like 'revenge.'"""
SLEEPERS,"Fact or fiction, I believe such abuse actually happens"
SLEEPERS,"""Sleepers"" is courageous showing a plot about the effects of the abuses and how the trauma affects the lives who suffered it forever ""Sleepers"" is the name given to young people who commit infractions and are sent to reformatories, as if during the time they were there it was a period of hibernation. But instead of dreaming, sometimes what happens is that they do not go through an apprenticeship that enables them to be reinserted in society. Generally, these delinquent children live, with their eyes wide open, a real nightmare. That's what ""Sleepers"" is all about.
The film, written and directed by Barry Levinson, best known for ""Rain Man"", features what might be called a constellation of actors, from Kevin Bacon (Footloose), Robert De Niro (Taxi Driver) and Dustin Hoffman (Rain Man) to Brad Pitt (Seven). But despite all these stars, Jason Patric, from ""The Lost Boys"", stars in the story set in the ""Hell's Kitchen"" neighborhood of New York. It's very difficult to know what Barry Levinson wants from the movies. He can sign Oscar-winning films without ever going down in history (""Rain Man""). Or that can go down in history for inconsequential (""Bugsy"") or catastrophe (""Toys""). The feeling of incompleteness that most of his works provide is directly proportional to the double commitment he seems to have assumed: to develop a line of intellectual films (in Hollywood's sense of the word), without scaring the public away (the so-called ""great audience"") of the cinema. ""Sleepers-Sleeping Vengeance"" is perhaps his most successful film, as he manages his commitments in a harmonious way.
The year is 1967, everyone in the neighborhood knows each other and lives with crimes in the streets and homes naturally, what happens outside the neighborhood seems to belong to another reality. In this scenario, a group of four friends steal a hot dog cart and the crime takes on much greater proportions than they imagined, leading them to Wilkinson boarding school, where they suffer all kinds of abuse and see their lives transformed.
The film is divided into three acts, narrated in excess by Jason Patric's character, Lorenzo Carcaterra, the author of the pseudo-autobiographical book on which ""Sleepers"" is based and a descendant of immigrants like everyone else in the group. In the beginning, it shows the childhood until the incident with good scenes. It's the most inventive part of the film in terms of filming and language, there are crane movements, long shots and tracking shots that give the story a good rhythm. Here, Levinson achieves much more than composing a correct setting. He describes the way of life, the poverty, the contradictions, the pleasures, the faith in this immigrant neighborhood. He creates an intimacy between the viewer and the places and characters he describes. Even the episode that triggers the plot (the theft, at first inconsequential, of a hot dog) is narrated in a light, humorous way, and produces a very efficient shock with its dramatic consequences.
This first half of the film, which narrates the childhood of the four friends, is, without a doubt, the best. Levinson proves to be a great storyteller in bringing such distinctive characters to life. We have Father Bobby, masterfully played by Robert De Niro; mob boss King Benny (Vittorio Gassman; the sadistic Nokes; and, of course, Bruno Kirby as the hero Shakes' father. In fact, Kirby steals the show as a fat, bald, extremely violent man with his wife, whom he repeatedly beats up times.
The second part shows the four boys who are taken to a reformatory at the Wilkinson Reformatory, where they are attacked and even raped by the terrible guard Nokes (Bacon) and his three shift companions. Here, Barry Levinson leaves the harrowing film that we hope will soon end all that torture those boys are subjected to. Frightened and watched by guards during Father Bobby's visits, they buried this secret along with their childhood. As in the movie The Count of Monte Cristo, naivety gives way to rancor and a thirst for revenge (Shakes even gets a copy of this book from Professor Carlson). It is a tense moment in the film, in which happy moments alternate with others a little constrained by the need to maintain good tone in the face of a subject that is not very favorable to this (sexuality).
But overall, Levinson says what he has to say. Here, we also have their exit from the place after their time in seclusion and what each became years later with the idea of revenge hovering over their heads. The director manages to convey with lyricism the feeling of the character Lorenzo Carcaterra at the moment of maximum prison: solitary confinement. The protagonist sees in his hand illuminated by a beam of light the projection of unfulfilled dreams. It is small moments and artistic freedoms like this that give a lyrical look that is often important and left out.
The story then jumps 15 years and now adults, fate offers an opportunity to do justice. From there, ""Sleepers"" changes focus and turns into a conventional judgment film in this third part. It was to be expected that the stellar cast, which mixes actors from different generations, would result in something not very functional. However, Levinson manages to ""tame"" possible ego flares very well.
Between crimes, court, conspiracies, ""Sleepers"" becomes uneven, alternating better and worse moments. What was initially proposed as a film of ideas (about poverty, the Catholic faith, adolescence, the tension between sin and innocence, salvation and loss) is diluted and becomes a film of stars. We turn to pay attention to the priest (Robert De Niro - There is one scene, in particular, worthy of note: when Shakes is telling the priest about the horrors he lived in the reformatory, the camera remains fixed on De Niro's face, who, without saying a single word, expresses all his grief and horror at what he is told), at the lawyer (Dustin Hoffman, great, as it hasn't been seen in a long time), at the prison guard (Kevin Bacon), at the sympathetic gangster (Vittorio Gassman) , in the ex-teens (Brad Pitt ahead).
The film's success has since revolved much more around its performances than anything else. The precision of the beginning tends to settle down, regressing to standard Hollywood humanism, fed by a plot capable of lulling the viewer for about 150 minutes and often leaving him curious about the evolution of events. The final scene is touching and celebrates the friendship between the boys, now adults full of trauma, but who enjoy a rare and final moment of happiness in a group, interspersed with the narration of the fate of each of the characters.
However, Levinson's long-winded script has its flaws. In addition to the film's pace dropping abruptly when it becomes a courtroom drama, as already said, we see perfectly expendable scenes that seem to have been included only so that the director could use them, once again, as a resource to get an Oscar. Not to mention that the film's tension point centers on a certain decision De Niro's character has to make. The problem is that, from the beginning, there is no doubt about what he will decide. Those who didn't find out weren't paying attention to the movie. Another flaw is the abrupt transition that occurs between the two parts of the story, which leads the viewer to wonder who those 'new' characters are. There is also a sub-theme that is practically just ""cited"" by the script, without being developed: the romance between the social worker played by Minnie Driver and the characters of Jason Patric, Brad Pitt and Ron Eldard.
At the time of its release, ""Sleepers"" established itself as a huge box office success. With a production budget of just $44 million, the film earned a final box office gross of $165 million. The film was even deservedly nominated for an Oscar for Best Score, produced by iconic composer John Williams. ""Sleepers"" does not disappoint especially in the performances and script. There is its great beginning, an uneven middle and the courageous conclusion to the constructed plot, showing. Shocking at times, with unexpected and strong scenes, ""Sleepers"" is courageous showing a plot about the effects of the abuses and how the trauma affects the lives who suffered it forever. It is one of those cinematic experiences that are worth it, even if they are not as remarkable as Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River (2004)"", shot years later and similar to this film."
SLEEPERS,"Obviously a worthwhile story enacted by a fantastic cast...but still not an easy film to like Director Barry Levinson also adapted Lorenzo Carcaterra's allegedly factual memoir about four rambunctious boys from Hell's Kitchen on the west-end of Manhattan in the late 1950s. The youngsters are incarcerated into a boys' detention home for 18 months after a prank on a hot dog vendor goes horribly wrong; there, they are molested regularly by a group of guards, and twenty years later two of the kids--now hell-raising adults--get their revenge by shooting the most vicious guard to death in a restaurant. The way the plot plays out, with a genuinely original take on the whole courtroom procedure, is rather brilliant...yet, on the other hand, the details of this story make the film difficult to wade through, and Levinson's style (flashing back to the attacks in blue-tinted staccato takes) is off-putting. Worse, Levinson's dialogue is occasionally thick with writer's ink--no actor could make it sound convincing--while short-cut tricks such as the use of narration over important footage falls flat. Imagine this story as told by a stronger filmmaker, say Martin Scorsese. ""Sleepers"" is too locked-in as being a 'prestigious epic'; somehow, the sweep of the narrative never catches fire, and it's never as moving as it is meant to be. There are still several very good sequences here nevertheless, and many of the actors (particularly Dustin Hoffman as an untried defense lawyer and Robert De Niro as a buddy priest) are excellent. **1/2 from ****"
SLEEPERS,"Poignant first part Sleepers is divided into two quite heterogeneous parts, where events are related in a rather heavy way by a continuous voice over, and through a direction that lacks a bit of ambition and that is sometimes too schmaltzy (emphatic shots, sad soundtrack).
The first part is dark and terrifying with this gut-wrenching and poignant story that unfortunately certainly must have occurred more than once. The second part however struggles a bit more and is often a bit lengthy, despite some excellent scenes, mainly the ones at the courthouse. Most importantly, the vengeance scheme and the trial seem very far-fetched and very little credible, therefore inducing strong doubts about their veracity.
As for the cast, it isn't as impressive as one could have thought in the first place. Apart from the excellent Kevin Bacon, no one really stands out: De Niro and Hoffman, though irreproachable, have too limited roles to be memorable, Pitt is too bland, and Jason Patrick isn't convincing at all."
SLEEPERS,"Disturbing, powerful, but lacking a certain something."
SLEEPERS,Not an automatic knockout
SLEEPERS,"Overkill ""Sleepers"" is about four boys who grow up in Hell's Kitchen, get sent to reform school, are abused by the guards, and seek revenge as adults. The film offers a good cast with all the trimmings but falls apart in story. It has plenty of 1970-80's pop songs for those who can get nostalgic over them. It has a tease at front and back ends for conspiracy theorists claiming its preposterous story in true. However, it runs too long, gets too convoluted, and is sorely lacking in credibility raising more questions than it answers. For those who find the subject interesting and can tough out a long film with brain disengaged a good watch awaits. All others may want to think twice before committing to this long winded Hollywood-by-the-book tale. (B-)"
SLEEPERS,"One of the best movies (and book) ever being told!! I love this movie for its honesty, and sadness... But most of all i feel for these 4 boys, and all the other young boys around in this world being abused. Carcaterra you have my respect! I think the cast in this movies is awesome and they all do an incredible job playing the main characters... The boys in particular... I am sure those scenes where they were abused was hard to do...This is a must see film for all people, and a must read book as well. It is brilliant, and really honest. A true story about 4 boys worst nightmares at a boys home, and how they got their revenge...It is so brilliant that i am amused it is a true story, and not a Hollywood written screenplay.... Amused in a positive way!"
AVATAR,AVATAR REVISITED
AVATAR,"It's an experience! A magical one. I was waiting for this day for the longest time. I was a kid back in 2009 when this movie released. So never got to watch it back then. But now when it rereleased I booked the first day show to a IMAX show and oh boy was I blown away! This is nothing short of a masterpiece! It's beyond belief how a film like this could've been made. Every scene, every shot is perfection. You are transferred to a different world and become so engrossed in the film. Never have I attended a movie where at the end of it people got up from their seats and started clapping! Last time this happened was after Infinity War. That movie too was a damn brilliant one. I'm from India and this is legit rare, where people go crazy, so crazy after any English film. This was one experience that I will never forget. I'm definitely going for it again next weekend cuz just once was not enough.
Every human on the planet needs to experience this magnificent work of art!"
AVATAR,Cameron Returns
AVATAR,"One of the best cinematic experiences ever... Forgive me, I'm going to jump from professional to fan boy for a while here. I haven't had the jitters after a film the way I've had for Avatar in quite sometime. James Cameron's Avatar is the most entertaining and enthralling cinematic experiences of my life. It is incredible, simply put. What Cameron has done here is the most passionate film project put out since Steven Spielberg released Schindler's List. His attention to detail and his zeal for pushing the envelope is so admirable to any filmmaker or actor who will ever do another film from this point on.
Avatar is the story of Jake Sully, a paraplegic marine, who replaces his brother on a secret mission to infiltrate the Na' vi, the colony of beings that sit on the planet of Pandora, where there is a precious ore, that sells at a ridiculous amount. When Jake learns the ways of the Na' vi, his feelings and learnings will put him and the people he trusts in dangerous jeopardy.
The performances here, in the sense of reacting, becoming, and understanding what Cameron has written are astounding. Not to be confused with a sensational bravura performance from some of the centuries best such as Marion Brando, Tom Hanks, or Diane Keaton; these actors along with the director inhabit these visual transformations with special effects as if they are have lived these beings all their lives. This is all based on character movements and reactions. Sam Worthington, as Jake Sully, is an actor who's on his way to becoming a star. Though he has problems with his Aussie accent often enough in the film, he gets the job done. Zoe Saldana, who plays Neytiri, a Na' vi huntress, is thrilling and electrifying. Stephen Lang, as the rock hard Colonel Miles, takes on a villainous turn to a new level in science fiction. He offers actual emotion and emotes evil to the audience and gains our hatred easily. Sigourney Weaver as the beautiful Dr. Grace, is sufficient enough to have on screen again teamed with Cameron. She lives inside her role with effortless ease, but suffers from some of the typical James Cameron cheesy lines.
Narratively the film works perfectly on the cinematic level. The first forty minutes or so require patience and hope as it is the weakest part of the film and offers some dreariness, but when the second act takes off, it's sky high with no limits for James Cameron. Avatar delivers the best action sequences put on film of all time. That is the boldest statement I have ever made in all my years of criticism. I sat on this for two days before charging it out, but I mean it. It is the best visual experience of my life, period.
Other than those visuals, the film pops with all the other technical aspects thrown into one. Art Direction is killer as the two worlds blend in perfectly for an acceptable time. The Film Editing is the crowning achievement of the film as it also offers the perfect blend of the two worlds, enticing the viewer and shifting us around. Mauro Fiore is the threat for a Cinematography Oscar this year. It was if the viewer sat down in a chair, put on glasses, and was literally placed on Pandora, spaceships, and floating mountains. The viewer can feel so engulfed by the imagery, you feel like you can smell the leaves from the trees. Avatar is utterly hypnotizing. James Horner's score is some of the best work done in his career. It offers a variable of devastation that moves the viewer to near tears. It goes back to his work on Titanic, where the musical instruments lifted the material immensely. The entire sound team is also locked and loaded for Oscar recognition as the feeling of animals, machines, and arrows buzzing by your head leave you imprisoned in Cameron's exquisite film.
James Cameron has come back home ladies and gentlemen Cameron is back, bigger, badder, and mature in his crowning work of his career. Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Titanic do not even compare anymore. This is the film that can blend the fans of those two films together and lock Cameron into your heart. He's a definite spoiler for a directing bid for the Academy Awards. You have admire the raw, natural talent the man has. How could you ever conceive such an experience and put that much effort and work into it and have it pay off? The box office success will surely keep him in the minds of voters for various critics' awards. His screenplay, leaps and bounds better than 1997's Best Picture Winner, is primed, developed and ripe for the taking. Though, you do acquire the tacky and atypical dialogue you expect from a science fiction director of this caliber, you can appreciate the effort and the honesty of it all. James Cameron is everything Michael Bay wishes he was, to put it bluntly.
Avatar will bring also great actors putting their best foot forward such as Giovanni Ribisi, who is as underrated as they come. Michelle Rodriguez who exudes sexy like any woman starring in a sci-fi epic. Joel Moore, showing his range outside of his comedic work in Dodgeball: An Underdog Story. And the classy veteran actors, CCH Pounder and Wes Studi, who just simply don't work enough.
Avatar is one of the best films of the year. The most exciting, thrilling, and superb work you'll feast your eyes on in any theater this century. Cinema, forever, will remember the benchmark that James Cameron placed not only for himself, but for any man, daring to change the game, the way Cameron did. Avatar is a movie experience to be remembered, and please experience in a movie theater first.
***¬Ω/****"
AVATAR,A NEW WORLD..... Hatts of to JAMES CAMERON for thinking and creating a vision like this. It takes a lotseof hardwork & research to build a whole new world. And there is a reason why this movie is still the no 1 movie in the world. I've never seen this kind of visuals in any other film. And this movie was made in 2009 that was an amazing achievement by the VFX creators & the director itself. You can easily get connected with the movie plot and the way the director has shown the Pandora world was just unbelievable. Cast of this film has done a fabulous job while performing so well and get into the character that not a single one will disappoint. Emotional scenes are so powerful that you feel the characters and their pain for what their suffering. Visual Effects makes this movie so powerful that every creature and big scenery scenes looks real. That's why it has re-released once again to feel the same experience. Don't miss this one on the big screen if you haven't seen it. It's a total new world experience. Can't wait for the PART 2....
AVATAR,"Visually mind-blowing, but lacking in the story I did see Avatar for the first time a while ago, and didn't know what to make of it. To me it felt like a visual feast if little else. Re-watching it again, I found more strengths, but there are several weaknesses that prevent it from being a masterpiece.
Starting with Avatar's strengths, it is absolutely mind-blowing visually. The cinematography, landscapes, scenery, colours, make-up and effects are outstanding and are by far and away Avatar's strongest asset. I also liked the score, it is certainly not the best score I have ever heard, but it had some very nice moments, while Cameron's direction is competent, the message admirable, and the finale well and truly explosive. I also loved the flying sequences, they were breathtaking.
The acting in general is a mixed bag. Sam Worthington is a charismatic enough lead, while Zoe Saldana is strong and spirited. Stephen Lang is an enjoyable and over-the-top villain of the piece too, however Sigourney Weaver is somewhat so-so, doesn't help really her character isn't that interesting while Michelle Rodriguez and Joel Moore aren't given very much to do.
What didn't work so well is that Avatar's story, with themes of love in a time of chaos and man alone in a hostile environment, is rather simplistic and predictable. I also felt it took a while to get going, and that the relationship between Jake and Neytiri was on the dull side. And is it me, or does this film drag at times, particularly towards the end? Now don't get me wrong, I liked the concept, it wasn't exactly original, as I often heard it described as ""Dances with Wolves in Space with rip-offs of Pocahontas and FernGully""- but I am not going to join those who say that- I have to admit regardless of its originality or lack of it the concept intrigued me. Then there is the dialogue, which is nothing special and never quite rings true. There are some amusing moments but a vast majority of the dialogue in the middle of the film never quite convinced or came across as cheesy. The characters also came across as rather clich√©d, especially Giovanni Ribisi's, and the character development was lacking.
So all in all, Avatar does have a lot of strengths, but a lot of weaknesses too. I will say I preferred it over The Hurt Locker, which to be honest left me cold, but I think I would be stretching it a bit if I said it was 5-star masterpiece. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
AVATAR,Technically impressive and important but beyond that there is not a huge amount to talk about
AVATAR,"Looks great, I just wish I cared what happened in it ""Avatar"" is not the next ""Star Wars"" or ""Lord of the Rings."" It might be the next ""Matrix,"" though. Or, perhaps more accurate, the next ""Matrix Revolutions."" It's technically groundbreaking craftmanship put to work on a story that was played out after ""Return of the King."" There are a lot of bad guys, a lot of good guys, and sooner or later they're all gonna meet on the battlefield. The little details are not-so-shockingly unimportant, since nothing could stop, change or even, really, comment on the unstoppable trajectory of this film's story.
It's the future. An Evil Corporation is parked on distant planet Pandora, mining the planet of all its precious minerals. The native population, big blue humanoids called the ""Na'vi,"" aren't too happy about this. The corporation has hired scientists to create avatars of Na'vi bodies to be controlled by human brains, in order to communicate to the Na'vi that...they better move, lest be bulldozed by the evil Col. Qautrich (Stephen Lang).
Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is flown in to Pandora because his twin brother, who had an Avatar made specifically for him, is dead. The coincidence is an obvious plot device so that we can have a newcomer to Pandora to share in our amazement. Oh, and he's paralyzed, so running around in his new alien body is rather freeing for him.
I don't feel as if I need to continue with the plot description. You know what'll happen. You've seen ""Dances with Wolves"" and ""The Last Samurai."" Heck, even ""Dead Man."" The Na'vi represent nature, the (all-American) corporation represents destructive technology. Quatrich has a Southern accent and says things like, ""we have to fight terror with terror."" The Na'vi are clones of Native Americans - filtered through the imagination of a white liberal. It's all very obvious.
The question, of course, is whether or not it's entertaining. Well...sometimes. It certainly looks good. Some sequences - especially those with the winged beasts - are eye-popping. Lang makes a fun villain. Pandora is more derivative than original, it reminded me most of Skull Island in Peter Jackson's King Kong. All the monsters have a plastic-y look to them that make them feel too well-done. The 3D is distracting at times and I had a headache before the movie was over.
But there are scenes and individual shots that pop with ethereal beauty. It's worth seeing for that reason, but I don't think it'll be as fun after multiple viewings. The great thing about ""Star Wars"" was the characters: Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, R2-D2, Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda and so on. They embodied the other-worldliness of the story, taking the weight off the effects.
In thirty-two years, I don't think anyone will remember ""Jake Sully."" 6/10"
AVATAR,"Incredible, inventive effects can't save this James Cameron's long-awaited Titanic follow-up is very pretty to look at but suffers from a flimsy plot and astoundingly stupid plot development. The characters are one dimensional, both as written and as portrayed, and there's hardly anything unpredictable. The only thing this movie has going for it are its state-of-the-art effects, which are truly boggling.
Sam Worthington plays Jake, a paraplegic ex-Marine who's sent to a distant moon to help humans mine a mineral called unobtainium (in the running for the least creative chemical name ever). Seems there's a huge cache of the stuff under a huge tree in a jungle that's populated by an indigenous race called the Na'vi, blue-skinned, really tall people with feline characteristics. Meanwhile, a scientific program headed by Grace Augustine (played by a typically stiff Sigourney Weaver) has focused on learning as much as possible about the Na'vi in order to benefit scientific knowledge. Augustine's research (funded by the same company who's mining the unobtainium) involves the use of avatars, in which scientists form a psychological link with a mock-up that looks just like a native Na'Vi, the better for the humans to exist within the unbreathable atmosphere. Jake gets inside the Na'vi within his avatar and attempts to find out what they would want in exchange for moving from away from the giant store of unobtainium; during the course of his mission, he falls for the Na'vi chief's daughter, Neytiri (Zoe Saldana). (Of course he does.) And as said mission drags on, Jake's perspective changes from meathead jerk to tree-loving jerk, and he begins to wonder if what he's doing is right.
Is he serious? You're an alien race (humans) and have no business on this moon. Your employer's stated goal is to gobble up all the jewels he can find, basically raping the planet. Your employer will stop at nothing to get it, as he answers to no one. You're being sent down to find a diplomatic way to screw the natives out of the bounty on which they sit. And he thinks this might be wrong? A power grab ensues when the military leader of the human expedition, a Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) decides enough is enough and wants to bomb the hell out of the Na'vi, with the approval of the head of the company, Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi), another patently obvious name. This sets up the rather obvious showdown between the primitive Na'vi and the gung-ho ex-Marine humans, who have missiles and guns and ammo and rockets and helicopters and who knows, even a Star Destroyer or two. The final battle scene is overtly reminiscent of the Battle of Endor in Return of the Jedi, in which the primitive Ewoks manage to defeat a stormtrooper army using only their quick wits and some old-school, homemade traps of destruction.
But even if the plot doesn't need to be complex, it sure ought to make sense. Here's a nonspoiler question to ponder. Jake, under the guise of his avatar, is taken in by the Na'vi, whose spiritual leader asks Neytiri to teach Jake their ways. Why this is to be is not terribly clear. It's evident that the humans have made several attempts at learning the ways of the Na'vi but that prior emissaries had been scientists; as soon as Jake tells the Na'vi that he's a warrior, they're all about teaching him. I don't quite follow the logic here; if I were the Na'vi and had not been able to teach the smart humans who obviously (to me) were not there to do me harm, why in the world would I want to teach someone who's used to using aggression and violence to solve problems? I get that the Na'vi, as a warrior race, would relate more to the soldier, but surely they would be reluctant to share knowledge with someone who was outside of their group anyway, let alone with one who might well do them harm.
Moreover, I'm not sure what the Na'vi thought Jake was, really. He looked like them, through his avatar, but they referred to him at least once as an alien. My best guess is that they just thought he was from another clan. Other clan? I'll assume that only this one clan, the Omaticaya, made its home at Hometree (yet another clumsy naming convention) and therefore was the only clan with a stake in protecting it. But if they simply thought Jake was from another clan, why did they let him in anyway? Why did they teach him? What purpose would it serve them? And on top of that, since the Omaticaya mentioned being approached by ""aliens"" before, doesn't it seem more likely that they would have assumed Jake was another alien ambassador anyway? This makes my brain hurt.
I think it's pretty obvious that Cameron wanted this to be his own Star Wars, an epic taking place on a distant world. He uses the standard Cameron recipe of astounding special effects and innovation coupled with a weak plot and laughable characters and hopes it all comes out okay (although for a movie that gestated for more than a decade, that's simplifying things a bit). The effects, it should be noted, are really mesmerizing visuals of the jaw-dropping variety. The 3D effects were unbelievable, and I mean that in a good way. Avatar is extraordinarily shot, using 60% CGI and 40% live action, and the two elements are flawlessly intertwined. It's a remarkable film.
But it's only part of a film. the entire movie seems to try pretty hard to keep some emotional distance from its audience, and when a film is emotionally uninvolving, it's lost the battle for your heart.
And that's the core problem. Despite some wonderful, beautiful effects, Avatar gives us characters in whom we can't really get invested, and when a key element of your story is an interspecies romance, this is a crucial, fatal flaw."
AVATAR,"Incredible scope and spectacle A film with the scope of James Cameron's Avatar was always going to be a risk both artistically and financially, especially in today's economic climate. Whether it will pay off monetarily is a question only time can answer, but this viewer can at the very least attest to it being an artistic triumph.
Avatar brings us as close as cinema ever has to actually visiting an alien world. The beautiful environs, the exotic creatures and incredibly lifelike natives of Pandora arrest the senses, visually, aurally and emotionally. The world in Avatar is the true star of the show. The amount of detail and work that has gone into bringing this new world alive is seriously impressive, and it will be a while before we see anything that overtakes it in scope and quality. WETA Workshop and ILM have truly outdone themselves.
Relative newcomer, Aussie Sam Worthington provides a solid human heart amongst all the science-fiction/fantasy beauty and Zoe Saldana gives an impressive performance as the 8 foot tall Na'vi, Neytiri. Even though the characters they both play are blue, giant, catlike aliens, they managed to evoke a chemistry and likability that pierces through the special effects.
That's not to say that everything is perfect. The story is basic and dare I say, clich√©d and predictable. We have seen it plenty of times in all forms of media. The bad guys are cartoonishly evil, and sadly paper thin. The love story, while charming, is also clich√©d despite being between man and alien. But in the face of these shortcomings, Avatar is a success because its storytelling lies in the brilliant visuals.
Avatar is a beautiful piece of film and a true event. It does exactly what cinema was always intended to - it takes us away from our problems and worries for a few hours and gives us memorable images which will undoubtedly and deservedly enter into the cultural lexicon to stay for the foreseeable future.

AVATAR,The best blockbuster in years - the master is back!
AVATAR,"James Cameron, welcome back!"
AVATAR,"Mr so-called ""King of the World"" returns with a visually dazzling spectacle and so-so story James Cameron has big ideas and big visions. Thankfully, the latter he dives into with a lust for cinematic glory and (with more money than some countries have in an entire year) he has made his vision of a planet called Pandora in the year 21-something something of a real wonder. If only his big ideas weren't, for the most part, cribbed from other movies and stories and archetypes. I would be reminded of Joseph Campbell's myth-buster formula that so many have taken to heart in adventure movies, but Cameron's formula would appear to come second to his attention to visual detail. This has its pros and cons, some more or some less depending on what viewer sees/hears in it all.
It is ambitious, and quite expensive, and it all shows up on the screen. It has to be said, Avatar is absorbing to look at. So much time and energy was spent into creating this fictional alien species, the Na'vi, and it pays off in the respect that Cameron's visual fx team painstakingly makes it appear real and otherworldly at the same time. We might recognize the lush and green surroundings, or even some of the trippy creatures, and if it comes close to anything it's like Ferngully: The Last Rainforest squared and made semi-pre-historic. But it's the scope and grandeur, and when we see the Na'Vi in close-ups or even just far away, you can see the sweat and the detail in their faces, the human beings playing them projecting off the screen. I forgot, if only for a few moments at a time, that they were animated and done in motion-capture. If part of a filmmaker's job, in a situation like a super-mega-sci-fi epic is to make us believe in another world and place (even if it's familiar), then Cameron has done his job very admirably.
So if Pandora is great to look at (especially in the practically prerequisite 3D, which also has its own levels of detail and nuance and doesn't just JUMP at a viewer), and if the technology shown on screen- of how a human being goes into an avatar, is fascinating, then why isn't it such a smash all around? Simple - the story, and the characters. Cameron does pay them attention, but only inasmuch as to get us going into the Pandora environment. When he has characters like Jake Sully (very good Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana, even better) saying such trite dialog and going through the motions of a story that is familiar to anyone who has seen Ferngully or Dances with Wolves or, to a lessor extent, Last Samurai or New World (super pro-environment, obvious anti-colonialist), it starts to drag the film with it. I never grew tired of the cinematography or the wonderful sights on Pandora, but could I have done without such one-dimensional gritting-of-teeth from Stephen Lang? Absolutely.
I'm not sure if there should be more movies like Avatar. It takes a filmmaker with the ambition and drive, and the super-screw-you-guys clout that James Cameron has with such a project (not to mention the time for it allotted him - not since Kubrick has a filmmaker taken so long between projects), to pull off something like this. CGI-driven movies could progress thanks to the prowess displayed here, but it does need to be done with the right frame of attitude towards the story. Even if such story is formulaic as this one, a filmmaker does need to try and push the technology a little further while also not forgetting about the human element. Cameron comes close... no, he does go over the brink of doing style over substance, but for this case- and maybe just this one time from an otherwise masterful blockbuster director- it's satisfying."
AVATAR,"Colourful Visuals . Black And White Storytelling I really did not like the way way this movie was advertised "" A film that will change the face of cinema etc etc etc "" . I'm one of those strange creatures who is actually turned off by hyperbolic markerteering . On top of that I'm not someone who's going to sit in a cinema wearing 3D glasses . It's bad enough being a speccy in real life . Who wants to add expensive insult to injury by sitting in a cinema looking like a muppet with shades ? In summary I had no intention of watching AVATAR in a cinema if at all
In April I found myself on a very long plane trip from Heathrow to India and decided that because I'd seen most of what was on offer I decided to watch AVATAR . Being on a plane where the format is cropped and missing the 3D visuals means that you're able to concentrate on the story . The truth is that the plot is absolutely threadbare and is padded out with long sequences that might seduce an audience in to watching the visuals but plot wise there's nothing happening at all
Fault number one - there's very little happening to the plot for large chunks of the movie . Fault number two is that character wise everything is black and white . Good guys ( Read humans ) are blacker than the darkest night while good guys ( Read blue skinned aliens ) are so white they're brighter than the sun itself. It's almost like watching a simplistic revisionary Western where the Indians are the goodies and the calvary are the baddies . I say "" almost "" because Hollywood has never come up with a Western like that and never will . There is no complexity involved what so ever . The bad guys are bad guys and the good guys are good guys and there's no motives involved . Some people may complain that LORD OF THE RINGS also suffered from this characterization but at least the LOTR wasn't a 3D gimmick and had saving graces . Take away the 3D and you'll find AVATAR has no other function as a marketing tool . Also nice to know it was stuffed at the Oscars by the cheap and compelling tiny budget THE HURT LOCKER"
AVATAR,"The most overrated film in history The plot is stolen from many different movies, there was only 3 good actors, the characters are either bland or stereotypical, and yet it made almost 3 billion. When I think a film is overrated I usually like it. I don't think of it as Oscar worthy, but I like it. Then there is Avatar a film I not only think is the most overrated film in history, but also on its own without the hype a terrible movie. It didn't have any effort put into the story at all. Star Wars took the ideas of many movies together to create something epic, but Avatar takes instead of being inspired by these things is just being lazy by stealing the ideas. It is an awful movie, but people and critics liked it. Why is that? Well that is due to the effects. Few watching, or reviewing cared about what the story was. All they cared about was the effects. Yes the effects and 3-D are great, but without the substance of a well written story it fails. I don't care if the effects are the best ever. Giving this film a good review based of the effects is like walking to your computer, and staring at the screensaver. You think it looks cool so you look at it. Next time you look up it is 3 hours later. Would consider that a good way to spend your time. No you would not, but you think that Avatar is worth your time. This a movie that is destroying filmmaking.

AVATAR,A Visually Stunning Chore To Watch...
AVATAR,"Even if it is sporadically decent or fun, it's mostly a bore A crashing bore. There is almost no real reason to see this film. As you could probably tell from the previews or other plot descriptions, it is a virtual remake of Dances with Wolves, but starring elongated, CGI, blue aliens. Yet even that movie wasn't nearly as patronizing with its noble savage bullcrap. I am not exaggerating when I say I have almost never seen a less imaginative movie. But what about the visuals, you say? Well, they are pretty, and the CGI is better than it has ever been in the past. But I'd say it isn't even close to a huge step forward. A pretty tiny step, really, from The Lord of the Rings' Gollum. The (motion captured) faces look more expressive than Gollum's. But they still have far to go before the CGI creations look ""photo-realistic"", as the idiotic Cameron likes to describe his cartoon characters and settings. And they still haven't worked out just how to move CGI characters - they still don't look like they exist in any kind of real world outside of a computer hard drive. But I guess by now I have to accept filmmakers are always going to rely on CGI, and it's always going to look like a cartoon. I have to say, I did mostly enjoy it when Cameron was introducing new jungle creatures (I think the final tally is about nine different species of animals that live on the planet), but both the flora and the fauna are reminiscent of black light posters and prog-rock album covers (I'll credit Jim Emerson for tipping me toward that, but I knew even in the previews that everything looked a little too familiar). And the N'avi? They're Native Americans. Cameron's allegory is easily the thinnest I've ever seen in a major motion picture. Some critics have argued about how it allegorically relates to current American military woes, but, frankly, if Cameron intended any of it, he screws it up royally by making the N'avi 100% justified in whatever they do. It's every bit as black and white as anything George W. Bush ever said. I'm sure he loves the Hell out of this film. And, even if I tried to just shut off my brain (pretty impossible), so much of the ride is uneventful. If not for the film's final half hour, which is comprised of the big battle, I'd probably call this the worst film of the year. As it is, I'd probably rather sit through Transformers 2 again. At least I can marvel at the audaciousness of Michael Bay's tastelessness. It's better than Cameron's utter blandness."
AVATAR,Best movie experience of the last 30 years...
AVATAR,"Avatar is a masterpiece & a breakthrough in cinema It was Terminator in the 1980's and then Titanic in the '90s and it's definitely Avatar in the 2000s!!
James Cameron is my most favourite director and he has once again broken all boundaries and created a visual extravaganza.
Avatar is Cameron's latest magnum opus is probably one of the most anticipated movies since Titanic and now it seems that the visionary director has indeed created a film that'll revolutionise the world of cinema.
The movie is set in the year 2154 and is about a man called Jake who can't walk and he is selected in the Avatar program where he has to go to Pandora jungle which is not a planet but it is one of the three giant gasses that is about 4 light years away from earth. On Pandora there are life forms such as the navis that are about 10 feet tall have sparkly blue skin, big eyes and tails. The humans have genetically bred human-navi hybrids known as Avatars. Jake is able to walk but falls in love with a female navi and now he has to choose the side between humans or the navis.
The film was absolutely fascinating, interesting, entertaining and emotional. I loved the look on the Pandora jungle and it must be the best scenery in film history and the navis are definitely the best digital characters since Gollum from The Lord of the Rings. The special effects are so amazing that Pandora looks like a real location and you can mistake the navis as real characters. Avatar was almost 3 hours but it didn't seem that long.
Avatar already makes it on my top 5 favourite movies and I intend to see it again and I am already waiting for it to release on Blu Ray because I'm sure that it will be one of the best Blu Ray titles."

AVATAR,"A cinematic triumph. Avatar is the kind of film that makes a cinema visit worthwhile, I saw it 13 years ago, and it lived with me ever since. It is of course known for its sensational visuals, but it is so much more than that.
It's a great storyline, I love the concept of the planet, The Avatars, Jake's story, it's just captivating.
It's moving, exciting, dramatic, it crosses over so many genres, it's the kind of film that takes you away from whatever you have going on.
You still cannot help but be blown away by the visuals, you could say it's arthouse in the mainstream, but it's more than that, this film was a game changer, the visuals even now are spellbinding. The animals, forests, effects are all tremendous, they've aged pretty well also.
Three tremendous performances, which have all always stood out for me, Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, and of course Sigourney Weaver.
I knew we'd get a follow up, I just didn't think that we'd be waiting 13 years for it, I can't wait to see it.
Glorious, 9/10."
AVATAR,"Visually Spellbinding! I am sure my comment will be lost in a sea of blue but anyways here goes...
Just attended the Advanced Screening at my local ""Event Cinema"" BCC in 3D
Now this movies graphics are gorgeous, everything is so real, the 3D just adds to the effect beautifully without distracting you.
From a technical standpoint this movie is amazing, just the detail on the Navi's faces are amazing, they feel more real then their real life counterparts!
Without giving anything away about the story, the plot itself is very solid, very character driven and perfectly executed by Jim, safe to say this is his best original story since ""The Terminator"" and ""Terminator 2"" and is definitely one of his best movies, so good it ties with T2 which is my most favorite movie of all time...
So for those of you who have not seen this yet... WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!

AVATAR,Great
IRON MAN,"A Marvel superhero film done with class When it comes to ranking the Marvel superhero(live action) films, Iron Man is for me up there with the better ones. It looks fabulous, the whole film is very slickly made with top-notch special effects(which look like time and effort was really put into it), awesome-looking futuristic gadgets and Iron Man's suit will be a guaranteed delight to anybody who is familiar or loves anything to do with the superhero. There is a pulsating soundtrack that adds much to the tension of the first half of the story and the enormously fun action sequences, which are exciting and tense with expertly choreography. The script crackles with smart humour that doesn't go overload, all of which is laugh-out-loud funny, yet the hostage plotting that takes up the first part of the film is intelligently written and somehow avoids being over-serious or over-familiar. The story has enough to allow you to emotionally connect with Iron Man(who I've always considered one of Marvel's most interesting and multi-faceted characters) and has a clever mix of the comic's 1960s origins and the effects of contemporary war, which will provide plenty of nostalgia while also feeling relevant. Jon Favreau does a great job directing, he never loses control of the story and he doesn't do anything too fussy. Robert Downey Jnr's performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man is a power-house and one of his best, doing much with the smart dialogue while making the emotional side of the characters wholly believable. Gwyneth Paltrow is a good, loyal side-kick with wise-cracks that don't come across as annoying and Jeff Bridges is surprisingly very good in an against-type role. Personally, the only disappointments were the useless character of Christine Everheart and the somewhat rushed and over-blown finale that wasn't quite as thrilling as it could have been, other than that Iron Man was a classy addition to the Marvel cannon and a great film on its own. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
IRON MAN,"Still one of the best MCU-movies In my attempt to rewatch all the MCU-movies chronologically I began with the first Iron Man. To cut to the chase: it's still good. A couple of things astonished me, though:
First of all, a common mistake of the later Marvel-movies isn't made here. There is actually some sort of character development visible. Tony ends the movie as a totally different person. Of course, in an origin story it's easier to have your protagonist change but let's compare for a second: Is Ant-man really a changed man at the end of the movie? What about Star Lord? What about Thor? Black Widow? Hawkeye?
Then again, you have to give it to the director that he really made a well-paced, well-balanced movie. There is action, humour, drama, world establishing, all in great balance. The final fight isn't stretched too long and therefore doesn't get boring. You can't underestimate this in our age of 45 mins battles at the end of movies.
During my re-watch I also noticed how 'down to earth' this movie is if you compare it to some of the more recent MCU-entries. It just looks more real than them. It's set in a world that at least COULD be real which makes us care more for the characters and their actions. More explosions and obvious cgi-effects don't improve a movie. So the movie doesn't feel as bloated as some other superhero flicks.
Finally, Iron Man is still fun to watch and not just a vehicle to set up a franchise. If you've spent the last couple of years on the moon and haven't seen any of the MCU-movies, give this a try."
IRON MAN,"This is where it all began. Queue AC/DC. MCU 2021 Marathon
MCU #1:
Iron Man was my favorite Marvel hero. As a teen I collected 1-150 with the main series. I doodled the Iron Man helmet during class at high school when bored.
So it was a huge surprise when this came out in 2008 and it was so freaking GOOD! Jon Favreau, the guy that had done Elf and Zathura (the Zumanji sequel) had just started a cinematic revolution? What!?!? (And Favreau is doing it again with The Mandalorian).
Robert Downey Jr. was made for the part of Tony Stark. The origin story was modernized and handled well. They included most of the early Iron Man suits from the comics. They took the time showing the more modern invention of the suit and the challenges of making it work (e.g. maneuvering with the repulsors).
I finally understood what Spiderman's fans felt like when Sam Raimi's Spiderman series became a massive pop culture sensation years earlier. Fantastic!
There are issues. Pacing mostly. Jeff Bridges is too much the stereotypical villain with an over-the-top fight scene at the end.
This was the beginning of the MCU world building effort which was more ""slight-of-hand"" in the earlier movies -- Stark's OCD making itself evident, that Shield guy at the party, and Samuel Jackson pinging Stark about Avengers in the end credits.
It began and ended with Iron Man. That makes me happy.
""I am Iron Man"""
IRON MAN,"RDJ is Iron Man Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is a hard playing billionaire genius. He is captured in Afghanistan after demonstrating his newest weapon. He is forced to create new weapons for his captor. Instead he makes an armored suit to escape. He also makes an arc reactor to keep his heart going and shrapnel from killing him. Once back in the States, he moves his company to concentrate on arc reactor technology and stop weapons manufacturing.
This is all RDJ. He and he alone makes Iron Man work. It's doubtful if anybody could have done it better. It's certain that he's made it next to impossible to replace him. Director Jon Favreau has built around him the dazzling array of tech fun, and Gwyneth Paltrow as his Girl Friday. It is RDJ's fast talking, quick wit, and personal history that makes him the perfect Tony Stark. Great character, fun movie."
IRON MAN,"Don't waste your life, Stark With a B-list superhero, a risky lead actor, a genre that hasn't really done much other than say Nolan's Batman, this movie had a lot to prove. Wow, did it ever. It proved that superhero movies can be realistic, emotional, funny and have highly entertaining action. This is the movie to launch the MCU, and started the shared universe that DC comics and other franchises are following.
Let's start with the number one reason why this movie is so good: Robert Downey Jr. I am so glad that Jon Favreau kept pressing the studio to make sure RDJ had this role because he completely nails it. He effortlessly portrays the cool, sarcastic, alcoholic, playboy that I don't even think he's acting. He's clearly not perfect as he is the guy we think is awesome but don't necessarily want to be. This role is basically synonymous with RDJ now because you can't think of Tony Stark without immediately thinking of RDJ. Iron Man wasn't a househeld name before but thanks to RDJ's performance, it is now.
The action in this movie is incredible as you get to see him fly around, take on terrorist cells and fight the main villain. What I even found to more intriguing is Stark's entire time building his suit, both in the Afghan cave and in his garage because it is amazing to see his genius at work, while still being snarky and basically a tool.
The writing and humor is also very good in this movie. I read that a lot of the lines, especially RDJ's were improv, which is able to keep this movie very fresh, not Rotten Tomatoes style, but it helps a lot by breaking the molds of superhero movies.
A couple complaints in this film is the pacing and the final villain. The pacing starts off very well, not really rushing into him being Iron Man, establishing his character very well before his abilities. Then the final battle comes around and it's basically just an evil version of his character, which sort of works with the problem of his technology getting into wrong hands, but the fact that it's just fighting a mirror is kind of boring. The final battle comes around pretty quick and it resolved fairly quick as if they are trying to wrap it up really quickly. I did like Bridges' Obadiah Stane with his intimidating yet charming persona but in the end he was just a reverse of Iron Man, not that interesting.
+ Robert Downey Jr + Fresh, new start for superhero movies + Writing and pacing (mostly) + Action and Humor - Final Villain
Final Score: 9.3/10"
IRON MAN,Best movie of a hero's origin.
IRON MAN,"Considering I am not much of a fan of superhero movies, this one is a success I finally saw this movie last night on DVD. Despite doing exceptionally well at the box office, I just never was that interested in seeing IRON MAN and only watched it after a friend gave me the DVD. In hindsight, I am glad I saw it, but think you should know at the onset that I am not a huge fan of superheros and comic books. This means that the film did manage to win me over but also that I have no knowledge of the story nor do I have the devotion to it that a typical fan might have. Take this for what you will.
Since there have been a bazillion reviews for this film already, mine will be rather short and I won't even bother discussing the plot--others have already done this very well. Instead, let's first talk about what I liked. The film was very slickly made and I really enjoyed the first 3/4 of the film. The Iron Man character and how he came to be was original. Also, I was thrilled that Gwynneth Paltrow's character was NOT like the one she played in SKY CAPTAIN (uggh)--having a tiny bit more depth and not behaving as stupidly. Robert Downey was very good as a world-weary jerk who grows as a result of his near death. What I didn't particularly like was Jeff Bridge's character--it just wasn't interesting and Bridges seemed awfully one-dimensional. Additionally, while I am sure fans loved the final portion of the film, it was a let down for me because it was all action. The previous 3/4 of the film was bolstered by good writing and dialog, but the end was all special effects. Still, I must admit that they were very, very good special effects.
Final verdict--A very good comic book film but not quite as well made or as interesting as THE DARK KNIGHT.
FYI--The character ""Pepper Potts"" appears to be a homage to the ladies played by the Monty Python actors in their series. Series regular, Graham Chapman, coined the term ""Pepperpot"" to refer to these dowdy and severely unattractive middle-aged ""ladies"".
UPDATE 7/2010--I just re-saw this film and the second time I was even more impressed with it. Robert Downey's great performance, the terrific soundtrack and the wonderful plot--it's simply an amazing film."
IRON MAN,"Don't waste it¬ÖIron Man There was a big question mark looming over the theatrical adaptation of Marvel's Iron Man property. It was in the guise of director Jon Favreau. Now, don't get me wrong, I love the Favs, but when I heard he was helming a big budget comic book flick¬Ölet's just say I was a little worried. Once his cast was set and the fanboys started humming across the internet I started to ease into the decision with high anticipation. Thankfully, after finally seeing the finished product, I was not disappointed in the least. With a great mix of the professionalism and stakes seen in both Spider-Man and X-Men and the comic wit and sheer fun of Fantastic Four, Iron Man shows how a comic can be brought to the screen successfully without all the added drama and weight. We finally have a film with the essence of what makes these picture books so popular, the action and mythology along with a sense of adventure and humor. Favreau never bogs us down with overwrought emotions nor speaks down to us with gags and poorly written jokes. Instead he delivers on his promises and gives us a solid initiation into what could be a great trilogy or more.
Favreau seems to have had an idea to get an origin story out while not boring us with long drawn out backstory. His ability to give us dual information at once is nicely orchestrated, showing Tony Stark in his basement creating while the TV in the background explains what is happening in the outside world of the Middle East and inside his own company. We as an audience are allowed to put the pieces together amidst the witty banter of Stark and the wonderful special effects. By the end of the film it is quite amazing how much information you will realize you now know, all culminating in a decent final battle, but more importantly a segue into the inevitable sequel. We are allowed entrance into the character evolution of Stark as he goes from war profiteer to man of action and cause, all while seeing the technology improve and advance before our eyes. Much like Batman, we have a hero here that needs help in fighting crime. He has no superhuman abilities besides his brain and being able to see his thoughts go from paper to reality is a feat of magic. Every stage is shown, every failure and success. It's quite the ride in and of itself, but when you add onto it the threat of global war and destruction, it can only get better.
The real success here is in the bold move of casting an actor over-40 to be a superhero. This takes guts, because no matter how appropriate it is, most studios would have said, ""no, change the story and make him younger so we can churn out as many of these babies as we can."" I don't know how he did it, but Favreau got Marvel to get Robert Downey Jr. to play Stark, a sarcastic lothario with the brain capacity of Einstein. I truly can't think of anyone better suited to the role and he proves it by nailing every single scene. I'm sure there was some ad-libbing, but even if not, his comic delivery and ability to switch on a dime to a sincere seriousness at will shows his masterful craft.
As for the rest of the cast, they all do well. Jeff Bridges plays the bombastic creature of villainy over-the-top, but appropriately so; Terrence Howard is nice as the friend and military liason, not given much to do, but definitely sowing seeds for the future; and Gwyneth Paltrow is good as the sweet assistant Pepper Potts who at times seems a little underwritten and more female prop than anything else, but comes through with some nice moments in a very comic sort of way. I also really liked Shaun Toub as Yinsen, Stark's savior, and Clark Gregg as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. Good to see Favreau giving another actor turned director props, (Gregg's directorial debut comes out later this year in the form of Chuck Palahniuk's Choke). I just wish he would have shied away from putting himself in the film. It's one thing to be seen split-second, (like Stan Lee), but its another to give yourself a thankless role with multiple scenes, just adding fuel to the fire on people's opinions of egotism stemming from the drinking game created off of the TV show ""Dinner for Five"" and how many references to Swingers was made each episode. I'll forgive, though, because, once again, I'm a big fan.
One can't forget that this is an action film above all else, so we can't just praise the actors; every effect is also quite brilliant. Those scenes of Iron Man flying amongst fighter jets in the trailer seemed really lame, but when in context they deliver. The suit itself is amazing as well, through every mach stage right to the end. My main highlight, however, was with the computer systems that Stark utilizes. The multiple screens, instant holographic reproductions, and ability to actually interact with those 3D representations is stunning. We can create them in fantasy, but it's just too bad we can't yet in real life.
Now Iron Man is not a perfect film, nor even a perfect comic book adaptation. What it is, though, is a fun, comic actioner that should light up the box office. The final showdown is a bit of a whimper in comparison to the backstory and machine creation; a crucial element is saved from destruction in the one contrived bit of screen writing, (not quite utilized in the way I thought, although still for the same means); and some moments seem a tad campy rather than witty, but otherwise this is some topnotch cinema that should definitely be seen on the big screen. I can't wait to see how the story progresses in a couple years."
IRON MAN,"Heavy boots of lead, fills his victims full of dread, running as fast as they can, Iron man lives again! Iron Man, the huge kick off to the big summer blockbusters of summer 2008, a great start. I have to say that originally I had my concerns, when I saw the trailer, this movie looked way over done and Robert Downy, Jr. as the hero? The guy is a great actor, but as a super hero? I wasn't so sure, but I was able to see Iron Man today and all my doubts were put behind me as I watched. This is one of best comic book adaptations put to film in a very long time, since the original Spider Man I think. The effects were not actually too over the top, only when needed, but it gave that extra feel of a comic book. Robert Downy, Jr., I couldn't believe how well of a performance he pulled off, there still is a little question of his casting, but he pulled off Tony Stark seamlessly. This is a very entertaining action film and is such a great blockbuster that is sure to please any film buff.
Tony Stark, rich, handsome, incredibly wealthy, has it all. He also creates war weapons, when he goes to Afghanastan to introduce a new missile, he is captured and told to create the missile for the terrorists. But Tony has other plans, he creates a metal suit and escapes, he goes back home and announces that he wants to retire and close down Stark industries due to the violence he saw. But when he learns that the weapons of his are in the wrong hands, he realizes that maybe he could re-create a metal suit and become Iron Man, the incredible machine to save man kind.
Iron Man is a sure fire hit that I'm sure you won't want to miss. It has everything you could want for a comic book film: action, humor, a great cast, romance, and ultimate effects that just get you excited. Even the soundtrack gets you pumped up and ready to root for Iron Man. The only complaint, as much as the action was cool, I wish it wasn't the war on terrorism they used, I know it's part of the story, but it hits so close, that it may seem inappropriate. The climax, a little cliff hanger, but I'm already smelling a sequel for next year probably. But Iron Man is a fun movie that all ages could enjoy, Iron Man is the new Spider Man for 2008!
8/10"
IRON MAN,"A Nutshell Review: Iron Man With a little tinge of shame and regret, my rare dalliances with the Iron Man character stemmed from a few one off comic books, as well as occasions during the teenage years of spending time in the arcade with those Marvel games, where Iron Man was one of my preferred characters because it came together with his incredible arsenal of weapons from repulsor beams to this gigantic cannon which accompanied the execution of some complex combo moves. There's something sexy about the red and gold suit of armour, and having an array of weapons at the disposal of a player, makes perfect sense for variety in dispatching your enemies.
This may irk the fervent fans of Iron Man, but face it, the superhero belonged to Tier B where superheroes are concerned, languishing behind easily recognizable peers who already have movie after movie being made. But thanks to the advancement in digital technology, bringing Iron Man to life no longer consisted of the prospect and worrying thought of having a man running about in a rubber suit passing it off as metal, the way Ultraman would have been done, complete with mechanical clicks and whirrs as sound effects to try and fool the visual sensory. Here, we have a very detailed rendering of the entire design from scratch to final modification, and we're in at every step of the way, with many cheeky and sometimes a tad implausible scenes just for cheap laughs thrown in.
I thought Iron Man the story worked because of stark (pardon the pun) similarities with Batman Begins, also an origin story which took its time to dwell on the man behind the suit, nevermind at the sacrifice of having less action sequences, or by not giving the fans what they want through the showcase of more than the basic powers. Advanced capabilities can always find room in the sequel, and as the first movie used to establish its characters, I felt that it succeeded, given too that it had a cast of capables (just like Batman Begins had) to pull the movie through without resorting to over the top and campy performances, starting of course with the lead in Robert Downey Jr.
In a nutshell, Downey is Tony Stark through and through. His affinity for the character shines, and no doubt it bore some parallels between his own personal, and Stark's life in the narrative future when he hits the bottle. He was allowed to become a Two-Face of sorts, on one hand being and later acting out his flamboyance self whose mission in life was the continuation of his father's legacy of Stark Industries, a weapons conglomerate, versus his personal mission in ridding his own weapons from the hands of the bad guys, now updated to be freedom fighters in the Middle East. The dialogue contained within each scene of Stark's, except perhaps during captivity, is full of one-liners done in double quick time, you probably would think it boiled down to a whole host of natural ad-libbing.
But while Starks spends significant amount of time in his unsecured basement building his masterpiece, his human interaction come in the form of faithful secretary Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) who actually, for the first time I admit, looked really good on screen as Stark's most trusted aide, bringing about some serious spark of sexual tension and chemistry between the two characters of opposite sex, more so than any other comic book movie I have seen. And good friend from the air force Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard) complete the circle of trust who knows of Stark's secret identity, and you'd be keeping your fingers crossed at the toss of a teaser of a certain War Machine appearance should the sequel be out.
Who's the main villain in the movie? It points the finger at Corporations, or at least here, the weapons manufacturers and the shady deals that go through in the name of profit, the sole objective for any corporation's existence. And Jeff Bridges, in a rare villainous role, got to personify that greed and wrestle for absolute power just like the trailer already suggested. While his performance is refreshing as he disappears behind the ball head and bushy beard, you could see his motivation and how the plot would have been developed to introduced the ultimate fodder for Iron Man to duke it out in a, sad to say, ordinary finale which any audience would probably be able to stay a step ahead.
As mentioned earlier, there are plenty of similarities with the Dark Knight of Gotham in Christopher Nolan's reboot, but more so because of properties inherent with the likeness between Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark. Both are incredibly wealthy to devote time outside of the day job to pursue their ""hobby"", both have to suffer personal tragedies in order to wake up to the cruel world, and in the movie, both fall prey to the corporate raider type, spend time perfecting their suit of war, have assistants they would trust their lives with, and of course save them from impending doom, and a finales set at their facilities.
But Iron Man is still a special effects extravaganza offering a thrill ride especially when he goes into battle mode, and without a doubt, Robert Downey Jr probably should be credited for raising the profile of this once Tier-B character, to perhaps becoming more recognizable now, and obviously, expanding the fan base of this weaponry filled suit of metal, which of course, in this origin movie, we were only given a glimpse of its potential. can everyone now spell sequel and clamour for more please? Iron Man has set the bar for the other upcoming comic book movies to try and surpass this summer season!"
IRON MAN,"Definitely the hero type. Held captive in an Afghan cave, Tony Stark develops and builds a suit, a suit that will change his life forever.
Well overall, I thoroughly enjoyed that, it took me a little time, as I found the first half an hour or so pretty slow, but once it gets going, I thought it was a thoroughly enjoyable movie.
I have always been a big fan of Robert Downey Jr. And once again he comes up trumps, I appreciated the journey the character went on, he truly does transform as the film develops. Jeff Bridges was great, I thought Paltrow developed well as the film went on.
I thoroughly enjoyed the story, the acting and the visuals. Of course I liked the touches of humour that Robert Downey Jr. Added.
Unlike some of the newer Marvel films I've seen, there seemed to be more focus on the plot and the characters, it wasn't just a special effects parade.
8/10."
IRON MAN,"more than an action movie this is one movie that was way better than i thought it would be.it's not just an action movie.it's also a smart,cleverly written movie,with some great dialogue.it also incorporates real global problems,serving as a sort of commentary on our times.it's not preachy,it just shows how far we've progressed.or maybe regressed as a society.there is also the theme of redemption in the movie.i mentioned the good dialogue.an example of that is the witty banter between Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr.)and his assistant Pepper Pots(Gwyneth Paltrow).beyond that though,Stark is generally witty.i liked the origin story of the film,though i can't say whether or not it's accurate to the comic book.naturally,there are some great action sequences,especially the flying scenes and the combat scenes.and that suit is very impressive,both in looks and functionality.as to the cast,Downey is very good as Stark/Iron Man.Paltrow is very likable as Pepper Potts.Terrance Howard is good as Stark's military friend Rhodey,but i feel he was underutilized.oh well,maybe the sequel will rectify that.i heard that Howard is being replaced in the sequel by Don Cheadle.nothing against Cheadle,but i think they ought to stick with Howard,since he originated the character in the film.but the best actor in the bunch,in my opinion is Jeff Bridges,who gives a William Hurt type performance,understated,yet simmering with passion and charisma.that's just my opinion.anyway,,the movie is fun and engaging,but it's no empty headed action movie.not that there's anything wrong with that.no,this is a smart movie with heart and soul.my vote for Iron Man: 9/10"
IRON MAN,"Not bad at all Fortunately, I'm not one easily influenced by some users' negative comments. These people should try to restrain their bias opinions and try to review the movies as neutrally as possible.
Now I would say that this movie has slow but steady momentum-building. It is a movie for people who has never known Iron Man in the comic series. The characters are given names and personalities, true to their comic book counterparts.
Acting was among the best comic-turn movie I have seen so far. Effects were believable and not overwhelmingly CGI, except for the tank scene.
This movie, however, has sequel written all over it. We know that because there are many scenes that could have lead to more.
It's well worth its ticket price."
IRON MAN,"Move Over Superheroes, Iron Man Is Here"
IRON MAN,"Delivers Intelligence & Great Acting with its Fun Rest assured, Iron Man is an absolutely amazing movie. I won't dare spoil any of this remarkable movie for you but I do recommend it as highly as I possibly can. Marvel needed to get in to the solo movie making business long ago. Instead of leasing out their characters to other studios, they're making movies themselves. Most everyone knows Iron Man is their first effort and what a great lead off film! This movie helps take the comic book genre to the highest level. Just like they did in the books, they reinvent standard epic adventure by ""Marvelizing"" characters and making them more believable. The Spider-Man and the X-Men movies did this to a degree but only as far as their respective studios wished to stay true to the source material. Anything added or amended was for the benefit of the live action adaptation. Director Sam Raimi pulled this off by talking to the summer crowd, not down to them with the Spider-Man series. Jon Favreau has done the same thing here but I think he's done it even better. Raimi intentionally threw in a little cheese. Favreau adds nice bits of humor but not too much. He also grounds the action and the suit of armor in firm reality. I've said it before but it's brave to reach for the highest common denominator with a big budget film and Favreau delivers a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity. Needless to say, Robert Downey Jr. and company deliver the goods. It's a movie that has a wonderful balance that delivers intelligence with its fun.
The amazing yet realistic action is paced by the plot and characters that keep you interested from start to finish. What absolutely blew me away were the phenomenal special effects. I know they built a practical, working armor. What I loved is the use of CGI was used to augment the real life armor and not create something from scratch. Most all CGI constructs feel fake somehow but the stuff in Iron Man didn't seem fake even for an instant. As great as everything looked, what really drives the movie is the emotional resonance and down to earth nature of the plot. Sure the concept is wild but it's all presented so that you really believe it could happen. I doubt anyone will find fault with this movie unless they went in trying to dislike it.
This is, without a doubt going to be one of my top 10 movies of 2008, quite possibly the number one film."
IRON MAN,"Marvelous¬ÖOne of the Best¬ÖStark's Snark, Wonderful Action, a Winner Marvel Studios Never Looked Back after this Tremendous Artistic and Commercial Success. It's Probably No Surprise that the Comic Book Company Knew just what to do with Their Own Creations. Although, Nothing in the Movie Universe is a Certain Thing, the Studio certainly Worked Wonders with this, one of Their Second String Characters.
The Casting is Brilliant with Robert Downey Jr's. Perfect Embodiment of Tony Stark, and Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, and the Rest Contributing to the Fun. The Director, Jon Favreau, was a Risk. Hardly Known for Big-Budget Action Movies, He Captures the Spirit of the Comics and turned in an absolutely Brilliant Film from Top to Bottom.
Fans of the Silver-Age Comics will No Doubt be Impressed. When Iron Man First Appeared in ""Tales of Suspense"" #39, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby were in the Embryonic Stages of Reinventing Comics and the Marvel Super Hero Line was being Tested and no one At the Time (except maybe the Fans) had a Clue what They were Witnessing.
In the Origin of Iron Man and for a while, the Character was this Hulky, Bulky, Tank-Like Hero, in a Clunky Iron Suit. Not the Sleek Hot Rod Red Iron Man to Come Later.
In the Film, this Likeness can be Seen in the Opening where Tony Stark Creates the Character ""in a cave with a box of scraps"". This is a Spot-On Recreation from the Comics Origin Issues and it is a Great Insider's Inspiration and a Fine Tribute to the Movie's Paper Origins.
This is just one of the Charms about Iron Man, The Movie. The Thing is Full of Wonder and Wit. A Great Comic Book Movie. One of the Best. Nuff Said.
Note...Thanks Jack Kirby wherever you are. Thanks so much for your Art and your ability to bring so much joy to the world. You are the best and truly ""The King of Comics""."
IRON MAN,"Wow, very impressive !!!! WOW WOW WOW.
This is the movie I have been waiting for for a very long time. I am an avid Ironman reader. I have collected the comics all my life (from #1 in 1968 to the latest in 2008)...40 years of Ironman. Since I was a kid, I used to say to my friends that they should make an Ironman movie, but everyone laughed and said that the special effects would look ridiculous...mind you, that was back in like in the early 1980's. But, now we are in the age of CGI, and what an age it is. Just for you Ironman fans, to see him come to life with such spectacular graphics is reason enough to spend your hard-earned $10. The plot is also pretty well thought out, and the acting is just fine. What better pick could you have for Tony Stark than Robert Downey Jr.? (just wait for the sequels when they can delve into his alcoholism...Mr. Downey has been there and beyond...that's probably why they chose him for the role...fore-thought)The rest of the cast is right on par, as well. The pace is brisk, and the whole thing works as a great addition to the Marvel Universe in the Cinema!! Enjoy!"
IRON MAN,"""Give me a scotch. I'm starving."" Outstanding movie and possibly the best Marvel's done to date, at least as far as their shared universe films go. Let's cut right to the chase: Robert Downey, Jr. makes this movie work. I'm not going to say he's the perfect Tony Stark because Downey's Stark is really very different from how he has always been in the comics. But it works far better this way and is a huge point in favor of deviating from the source material, which is the eternal struggle between Hollywood and anything it adapts. This is one case where the changes they made worked out great. The rest of the cast is terrific, all following Downey's lead very well. His enthusiastic performance is a joy to watch. I'm sure it must have been a ball for Paltrow, Bridges, and the rest to act with him as they all seem to be having a great time in their scenes together. Jon Favreau does a praiseworthy job of directing, especially when he hadn't really done this type of movie before. The action and special effects are great. The script is smart and funny, though a lot of the humor comes from the ad-libbing of Downey and co-stars, so I'm not sure how much credit I can give the script for that. It's really a wonderful piece of entertainment without being mindless or crude. One of the best superhero films ever made."
IRON MAN,It's the big Robert Downey Jr show - and I like it!
IRON MAN,Iron Man Burns Bright In Red & Gold!
IRON MAN,"Great Movie! Iron Man is one of the better superhero movies. It's based off the popular Marvel comics. On one of the reviews, I was shocked to see that the person liked the new Hulk better. I agree that Hulk is a great movie, but Iron Man is 100 times better. Tony Stark, a popular weapons company owner gets kidnapped by a cult called ""Ten Rings"" in the Middle East. They want Stark to build a weapon for them. Instead he builds his Iron Man suit. He eventually escapes and later becomes Iron Man. Will he have revenge on the cult and it's surprising leader? You'll have to watch to find out. The acting is better than expected in this film. Robert Downey Jr. did such a unexpected great job. Gwyneth Paltrow did well as her role of Pepper Potts. I also liked Terrence Howard as Rhodey. The special effects were great as they are with superhero movies. The plot has its share of intriguing twists. I believe that this Iron Man is original, but that is my opinion. I rate this movie 10/10."
IRON MAN,"Sooo Goood When you look back at the influence of Marvel on cinema over the years you have to recognise it as significant. They have changed the types of movies that have been made for 20 years (and it doesn't look like ending soon).
This success of Marvel started with Blade, X-Men and Spider-Man however it was Iron Man that really launched the juggernaut that has become Marvel.
This is one hell of a movie. Yes it lacks the real gut-wrenching depth of the Dark Knight Trilogy, but it wasn't really aiming for that.
This is incredible action, humour met with a good story and the most excellent decision to cast Downey in the titular role.
Hit the lights, pump up the volume, popcorn at the ready....GO GO GO"
IRON MAN,Very Good
IRON MAN,Hits a High Standard of Excellence... GREAT Film.
IRON MAN,"Iron Man Review By Kamal K
Iron Man, one of the most important movies of its kind. When it first came out in 2008, I don't think anybody expected it to be as big a hit as it was. A B-list superhero played by a washed-up actor being produced by a barebones studio? Are you nuts? And then we were all surprised to see how great it was.
It's thanks in large part to Robert Downey Jr. He really is Iron Man. He manages to give that real sense of a ""genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist."" It's hard to imagine anybody else playing Tony Stark this far along in the franchise's lifespan.
This movie was most people's entry point into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Having only recently re-watched it, I still can't believe how small it was at this point. Nowadays we see aliens, talking raccoons, and sentient trees, but Iron Man has a realism to it that keeps it grounded while still being comic-booky.
Twelve years after its release, the special effects still manage to hold up. The Iron Man suit's CGI still looks as real as possible, and it would still be in the same elite company as movies like Thor: Ragnarok or Ant-Man.
Again, this is a movie that really shouldn't have worked so well, but I'll be damned if Jon Favreau and Kevin Feige didn't pull it off. It's a movie that I'll return to for years to come, if for no reason other than to marvel (heh) at how much Tony Stark has grown up since. Can't wait for new fans to experience this movie as well as the rest of the MCU."
THE HUNGER GAMES,"Silent Thrills The Hunger Games is ought to be the next big thing like Harry Potter, except it already started in a darker and more serious tone than any other young adult fantasy book films. The film did a good job executing its grit and thrills. Decent directing and amazing performances. The filmmakers did a fantastic job bringing Suzanne Collins' book to life. It's not the usual kind of blockbuster that focuses to its loudness. It's a film with moving drama and has its suspense.
It's pretty easy to understand everything about this story and its world. We get to know most of it and the entire film is intriguing and undeniably entertaining. The cast brings most of it to life. Jennifer Lawrence is simply fantastic as Katniss. Josh Hutcherson is okay but does not tie with Lawrence. Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Wes Bentley, Donald Sutherland, and Stanley Tucci didn't get a lot of screen time but they were good to their roles.
The movie is great in suspense and drama. It doesn't have a lot of score which makes it moving and compelling. The moments of Katniss in the arena are stirring. Thrilling music score is a great effect to these sequences. Unlike our blockbusters these days, the film doesn't focus too much to the CGI and the explosions. There isn't really much explosions here. Surprisingly, the filmmakers aren't lazy to create a non-CGI set(except the chariots). There is, of course, still CGI here but not as excessive as our modern blockbusters. The action is pretty good with the shaky camera. It's nicely shot gives enough momentum and excitement. Most people complain to that though. Lastly, the production design is beyond decent.
The Hunger Games is thrilling and solid enough. Decent filmmaking made it spectacular. It's amazing and intriguing enough to start a big series. It succeeds to become a solid and one and not a lackluster like Twilight or I Am Number Four. I don't know what else to say about it, but it's silent, gritty, and compelling."
THE HUNGER GAMES,I'm shocked! I loved it!
THE HUNGER GAMES,How can this be a cult movie?
THE HUNGER GAMES,"Well, it's no Battle Royale... There's almost nothing to say about a movie like The Hunger Games -- it's been so worked to death to be a successful blockbuster that all of its edges, the things that make a film good or bad, have disappeared. It just exists as a spectacle, a finished product that defies any critical lens.
I could go on about the particulars of the adaptation -- the ridiculousness of the entire Capital setting, or the sometimes disorienting shakycam work, or the great cast of adults patiently playing supporting characters -- or the source material -- the gestures at social commentary, the way that the story protects Katniss from ever having to morally sully herself -- but they all seem to be beside the point. Look. The movie has the things that happened in the book, but in a movie, competently shot and acted, with absolutely no risks taken. If you liked the book, or want to learn what this whole Hunger Games thing is about without having to read the book, you'll probably like this. It's a digestible film, even an enjoyable one, but in the end it's not really interesting or memorable. But to be fair, it wasn't meant to be."
THE HUNGER GAMES,"Not quite the Battle Royale Thrilling,Engaging and entertaining dystopian action sci-fiction flick. Really liked the visuals and all the action scenes. This is the real deal of Drama and action. Screenplay,costumes and make up all are decent. Especially the make up and movie sets are very beautiful and elegant which make the people from novel come to life. Now,considering the novel,this movie adaption misses a few things i wanted to see on screen. One is I expected it to be more violent on screen with a R Rating but they made PG-13 Stuff, i don't know why,to make more money i guess. That shaky cinematography too. some of the important messages had been cut down. These things really disappoint me because i loved the novel and wanted it to be more precise. other than that it is good popcorn entertainer. Loved Jennifer Lawrence though. Acting is far far better than that Kristen-NO-Expression-Stewart. Not only Jennifer but all the actors did their job very good. Now looking forward to sequels.Hope they will be better."
THE HUNGER GAMES,Everybody cheer the state sponsored child murders!
THE HUNGER GAMES,"Spoilers! But don't worry, it's already predictable and weak."
THE HUNGER GAMES,"Battle Royale with cheese In a cinematic world of re-makes, re-imaginings and full-blown copies, it's inevitable to see a movie like The Hunger Games wallow in the limelight and hysteria of mainstream banality and post-Potter hunger simply because it's there. Adapted from Suzanne Collins' trilogy of teen- friendly novels, The Hunger Games looks set to follow in the well-off footsteps of Harry Potter and the soon-to-cease Twilight as the next big-money, low-brow saga for the GCSE bound masses.
This moderately engaging adaptation of Collins' first novel plays like a pre-teen spin on Battle Royale. Director Gary Ross shoots for a futurist-retro sense of uprising, endurance and wonder and in the eyes and minds of 11 year-olds, he's on target. There's plenty to behold, but little to absorb. Despite all efforts, The Hunger Games is starved of a character or scenario to really care about.
A hyped-up, cheesy and dumbed down treatise on human nature, spirit, freedom and TV culture, this is a badly-acted, action-crammed movie built on a much explored prophecy that's been residing in both literature and film for years; a nightmare dystopia in which society is slave to a tyrannical regime. But what do you know; there's a rebellion on the cards. And guess what? It's only lead by an unlikely yet inspiring hero. The Hunger Games is nothing new, then, but hold your horses; pitting 24 kids against one another in a game of death on a top-secret island is an original idea that's sure to evoke sympathy, shock and compassion. Isn't it? Well, maybe, but not if you know your films; not if you've seen Battle Royale.
A bloody slice of social satire with shock and awe to spare, Battle Royale was by no means the first to offer up a glimpse into an oppressive fictional world where people are forced to fight to the death. Sparticus, Running Man and even Gladiator all touched upon on this idea of enslaved cock-fighting for the ""greater good"" and fun of a bent society.
Suzanne Collins' tale may not be a rip-off of Battle Royale, but it is a blatant source. In director Ross' big screen retooling, The Hunger Games is set in a far from terrifying, post-war America whose totalitarian government get their kicks from a legislation born out of the ashes of World War III; each of the country's 12 districts are to offer up one young girl and boy every year to slog it out on live TV in a last-kid-standing tournament set on a virtual island. This; a sacrificial homage to a nation's thirst for blood and conflict. A punishment for an early, post war rebellion. A tribute to state power; The Hunger Games.
The film follows Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence), a steadfast teen who puts her life on the line when she volunteers to replace her younger sister in the upcoming games. What follows is a predictable tale of heroism and self-sacrifice as Katniss and clunky love interest Peeta (a wooden Josh Hutcherson) are wined, dined, trained and then hurled into a giant lion's den full of determined, blood-thirsty brats who are there to win, to kill. Will Katniss and Peeta fall in love? Will they both make it out alive? If not, will one of them be the victor? Do you care?
The Hunger Games is a self-assured, self-important piece of profit-reaping cinema whose potentially bleak and barbaric set-up cannot be realised through on screen peril, atmosphere, gore and violence due to its mild target audience. Alas, there is a lot of hand-held camera-work and rapid editing to cover up the scuffles, scraps, impact and blood. It doesn't work. Over-hyped and overdone; turns out it doesn't take much to tailor a totalitarian future concept for the modern-day youths; just strip it of all depth, complexity and darkness, throw in some weapons, some fire, a bit of romance and some heartthrobs and you'll be laughing all the way to the bank."
THE HUNGER GAMES,"Perspective from a VERY senior citizen This is not so much a review, everything has already been said in the other postings, but rather my experience with this movie and book.
OK, look, I'm probably old enough to be the grandfather of most of the people submitting reviews to this movie. I am not into the teen age drivel that seems to be everywhere you look these days but .....
I first heard about the story when the book came out. It seemed you couldn't turn around without hearing it being discussed everywhere. The enormous hype made me mildly curious, but not so curious that I wanted to read the book. Fast forward several years: the book had been out, the movie hade been out, the DVD had been out and only then did I accidentally stumble across the DVD at the library. I could check it out for free and if I didn't like it I could turn it off after ten minutes ... so, why not?
I immediately found myself captivated by the beautiful cinematography and background theme and despite the over-the-top and ridiculous costumes and makeup of the people in The Capitol I decided to continue watching. I was drawn deeper and deeper into the story and the characters and after about a fourth of the way through I knew I was hooked. The acting, starting with Jennifer Lawrence, was exceptionally good. I have to go through about 25 movies before I find one that I can say I absolutely loved ... this was a 25er.
To finish my story: unbelievably, when I returned the DVD to the library, on a table in the lobby of the library where they sold used books cheaply, I found a mint condition copy of the book (the big paperback format) for fifty cents. I grabbed it. I began reading the book when I got home and couldn't put it down even though I already knew the story. Collins' writing style was as captivating as her story and the very few differences between the movie and the book were not worth mentioning. Actually, I thought the movie version of the ending was better (just couldn't imagine Rue as a werewolf).
I now own, and have seen and read, all of the books and movies of the franchise and consider them among some of the best entertainment of my life. SO it seems the old adage is wrong because you really CAN teach an old dog new tricks. Other young adult movies came out after 'The Hunger Games' which tried to capitalize on the same type of theme and they, by comparison, have failed miserably in my estimation."
THE HUNGER GAMES,Poor Adaptation
THE HUNGER GAMES,derivative and boring
THE HUNGER GAMES,Didn't read the book - but ugh
THE HUNGER GAMES,"Nice adaption from the book, but... One of the things I liked the most about reading 'The Hunger Games' was the intensity of how it was written. Feeling the story seemed maybe even more important than reading it, so when I went to see the movie, my expectations were very high.
On the upside: Great performance by the main characters, excellent visuals and well directed.
On the downside: The book gives a lot of context as to how the characters feel and how things have come to be the way they are. The movie changes a number of things to make it at all possible to show the story and for me the choices made took down the quality of the story a bit. To give at least some context, it took the movie a while to get really started and even despite that, some of the characters, again in my opinion, didn't really develop in depth the way they should.
Long story short, I liked the movie and thought it was a nice adaptation from the book, but it lacked a bit the intensity from the book."
THE HUNGER GAMES,"A true game-changer for movies aimed at teens. Let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan of the ""The Hunger Games"" book series by Suzanne Collins. I've read them countless times and when I found out they were making a movie of them a little over a year ago I was very excited. But I was also worried.
""The Hunger Games"" is not very easy source material. The book is written in first person narrative with very detailed descriptions of everything form the characters' looks to the strange futuristic devices they use in Panem, the future version of the U.S. where the story takes place. I couldn't imagine that they would be able to convey every detail as I had imagined it and make the story believable without an R-rating or a huge budget. All of my concerns were wiped away when I saw the movie.
I've never seen a more faithful adaption of a book in my life. All of the costumes, the sets, the locations, the cast (I'll talk more about them in a while) and the pacing is as if they were exactly replicated from the book. And the small things that do differ or are added (such as more insight to the gamemakers' control room) only add to the amazing world Collins created and improve the narrative movie-wise. And the movie is great for people who haven't read the books as well. Not once did I feel as if something was vague or badly explained.
The cast is stellar. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss carries the movie and makes me regret complaining about her casting because she was too ""hot"" and not starved enough. She IS Katniss and one can feel the graveness of an situation just by looking at one of her expressions. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta is also a true breakout performance. The way he looks at Katniss will makes girls all over the world envy her, just like it's supposed to be. Other standouts in the cast include Stanley Tucci as the flamboyant talk-show host Caesar Flickerman, Woody Harrelson as the sarcastic but caring mentor Haymitch and Wes Bentley as the sinister game-maker Seneca Crane (his final scene might be the best one in the whole movie). The child actors Willow Shields and Amandla Stendberg who portrays Prim and Rue are believable and heartbreaking even though they're inexperienced.
Despite the PG-13 rating the movie doesn't gloss over or sugarcoat anything for their audience. The violence may not be gloriously graphic but it's still there. People will feel the tributes' pain and despair and not even realize the violence isn't gory until you've left the theater. The movie also deals with important themes like survival, governmental control, grief and helplessness. There is a minor love story subplot, but it doesn't distract from the movies main themes. In my opinion I think it rather improves them by showing some light in the dark.
The only complaint I can think of is that the movie feels too short. It's almost two and a half hours long, but it feels as if it goes by in a blink. I will have to see it again to fully pay attention to every detail (such as the costumes and animation of the Capitol, which looked amazing). But this is still not me saying that the movie is rushed, because as I stated the source material is very dense and the filmmakers managed include almost everything.
People are expecting this to become the next Twilight-style teen movie franchise. I can't say I think the two stories have anything in common even though I hope ""The Hunger Games"" will do as well at the box office. But if the first movie is any indication of the quality of what's to come - this will be a series way out of Twilight's league."
THE HUNGER GAMES,"(Battle) Royale with cheese...and a side order of over exaggeration. So as a movie enthusiast and a Cineworld unlimited card holder i do my fair share of visits to the cinema. Of course when a film garners interest the trailers become more and more prominent; this could be said for the newly released ""Hunger Games:Catching Fire"". Constant trailers and advertisements on TV....which led me to think...well i haven't even seen the first one yet. This led me to take up the opportunity that CineWorld had put before me, in seeing the first film in the Cinema in a one day special showing of the 2012 blockbuster.......
....but oh how i wish i didn't. Fast Forward to the end of the film and i walk out wondering what all the fuss is about and ahead of me i see an ever growing queue outside of anxious teens awaiting the midnight showing of the sequel. And it hit me like a bullet. This is why there is so much hype. I mean there could be no better an example of teen power than the Twilight saga. And this is very similar. Has any of these nutters seen ""Battle Royale""? That is how you do a film focused on individual survival. That is a film that shows you the depths people will go to survive. It doesn't hide from the violence and it doesn't over complicate it. It is live or die. Simple.
Now this farce of a film is more focused on creating a love triangle between Katnis, (Lawrence) Gale (Hemsworth) and Peeta (Hutcherson). All this district nonsense, all this sacrifice, all the deaths...just for a love triangle. That is what the underlying story and forthcoming films are going to be all about; twilight anyone? It is one of the cheesiest films ever; made me cringe so much i was almost sure my spine would snap at any moment. That my head would go all exorcist and just keep going when i constantly turned away in dismay. This film is successful because of the vast amount of teens who are vacuumed into love stories and won't let go until a shirt is taken off. And anyone over the age of 18 who still enjoys this needs to grow up and go watch Battle Royale and that'll show you what would really happen in a circumstance like this.
The film takes almost an hour to start and when it does start, it actually doesn't. It's slow, uneventful and the characters they try so hard for you to feel sympathy towards are so incredibly unimportant that you simply don't care.
Yet another film, that is over exaggerated, over hyped, over advertised and over the top with cheese.
2/10 (and that's me being nice)"
THE HUNGER GAMES,"Surprisingly safe and sanitised ‚Äì lacks the horror, satire and commentary it could and should have had"
THE HUNGER GAMES,"Confusing, boring and unpleasant. When The Hunger Games came out, all non-book fans could think of was Asian flick Battle Royale of which I think is an okay but forgettable movie. Meanwhile, the concept of a televised people vs. people contest always reminded me of Arnie nostalgia-classic The Running Man. In retrospect, it's a pretty cheesy movie, but its execution with all its 80s gritty excess makes the idea chilling and believable in its dystopian world. My biggest problem with The Hunger Games is that never once did I feel the concept fit the world. I think it's a pretty good setup with the idea of a uprising that didn't work and that the upper class would punish them but with a kid v. kid battle to the death? There's something about the film that never once convinced me and it lost me right from the outset.
Perhaps this is because the film so far removed from our world that there's no relatable one. On one hand, there's the districts which feel like a cleaned up Deadwood then there's the Baz Lurhman does Dr. Seuss civilized world. There's no believable sense of time transition from how it can get to its opening written setup to this world with its infrequent odd sci-fi flashes. It's trying too hard to have social commentary. Above all there's no heart beyond teenage angsty feelings and no sense of a morality we can relate to - albeit, Stanley Tucci was a delight and I wish he could host everything ever. Yeah, Jennifer Lawrence's protagonist is brave and I supported her but the writing was so underdeveloped that I found myself confused at what she was or wasn't doing a lot of the time.
The film is just so contrived to try and force the concept to belong in this world. The plot is relatively easy to follow but there's way too many times when I found myself asking ""why are they doing this?"" without explanation and ""why don't they just do this?"" without ruling the alternatives out. I feel like the film never took a moral stance on the killings. Sure, the civilized world find it entertaining/punishment and the Deadwood world finds it tragic, fine, but I'm interested in the internal feelings of the ones actually involved. It just felt like their plan was ""to win"" but strategies were never revealed. Why didn't they just slaughter everyone while they were ""training"" with all the weapons? If they weren't allowed, why didn't the film demonstrate it beyond the few words ""don't fight here""? I never bought it.
Maybe their plan was to just survive the best they could and stay hidden, but this was never stated. Why were people making alliances when there could only be one winner? It never made any sense, especially when there was absolutely no character development. Perhaps this is what you get with a film that's about the one thing it can't show with a PG-13 rating and shaky cam. I imagine these kinds of morality and strategy things are in the book and fans are just filling in these gaps by themselves, but The Hunger Games movie just confused and bored me with its slow plot-hole ridden script, unpleasant hook and unsatisfying climax. Give me The Running Man for the dozenth time instead, at least it has a bit of balls when it comes to its action.

THE HUNGER GAMES,"Not quite ""Battle Royale"""
THE HUNGER GAMES,"""Battle Royale"" without the stinger ""The Hunger Games"" was an instant hit when it came out, so I'm pretty sure I'm the last person in this universe to see it. Unfortunately, it sorta felt like I was wasting my time. The movie seemed like equal parts ""Running Man"", ""The Truman Show"" and ""Battle Royale"", but with all the clever elements from either of those movies removed. I don't get a kick out of gratuitous violence or something, but spending the first hour on build-up that will barely have any effect on the plot is looooooooong. Take for example all the scenes where they have to impress possible sponsors (to provide outside help) with their fighting skill, sponsoring comes into play so rarely later on that all those scenes are completely cuttable. During the actual hunger game/battle royale, you still don't get much of an action or adventure movie. They're after pulling heart strings mostly, including the incredibly stretched-out death scene of a character we literally know NOTHING about (a full action-free hour wasn't enough to establish some traits?). The most bothersome thing about the movie though it how freaking convenient everything is. Our main cardboard cutouts (granted, Jennifer Lawrence does the best she can with the material) are up against highly trained manhunters, heavily bleeding and leaving traces all over the forest. How do they not die on the first day? How does nobody spot them when they stand there crying and screaming in a wide-open space? Some other character lights a small fire and is killed within about three seconds, but I guess you can't act stupid if you're not important to the plot. The main characters don't survive because they're so strong, so creative, so quick or so fearless: they survive because the script says so. Therefor there's barely any tension, you can predict everything beat for beat. Given its massive success this movie's got to have lots of appeal, but it must have missed me by a mile."
THE HUNGER GAMES,"Paper thin and watered down The trouble with this movie is that I'm old enough to have seen many of its antecedents. So before The Truman Show, which is essentially the same idea as The Hunger Games, we have Battle Royale, The Running Man and of course, Rollerball. They all deal with mass entertainment in a dystopian future society and they all have their flaws. What's really disappointing about The Hunger Games is that unless you've read the book, the film will give you only a fleeting glimpse into why the games are called that. There's nothing else to help the naive reader make sense of the plot and because of this, the involvement of children will seem a bit odd to anyone who hasn't read the book. In fact, that's something you should take into account when reading many of the reviews of the film as they're written by people who have read the books and can fill in the wide gaps in the film without even thinking about it. Some have said its plot line is mildy satirical, but in my view that's just an excuse for a poorly filleted and disappointing adaptation of a marvellous book."
THE HUNGER GAMES,"Battle Royale for the young ones I am referring to the audience watching. Because the original Battle Royale (japanese movie) with a similar theme, was more of an adult version of this movie right here. Having said that, the idea is so good it translates to the screen, even if it is watered down a bit. Plus I was just enjoying the girls moaning and exhaling in general while watching this and finding romance even in the weirdest of situations. Throw in Lenny Kravitz, Elizabeth Banks and the always reliable Stanley Tucci for some acting/weirdness weight and you got yourself a movie.
Apparently though the movie has not covered everything the novel had to offer (which should be no surprise). What should be a surprise to anyone who was living outside the US, is the fact, that this was one of the most anticipated movies in recent history (though I'm more than happy that The Avengers beat them at the total box office of course). Better drama, story and acting than Twilight, hopefully it stays that way and won't dwindle down the road ..."
THE HUNGER GAMES,"Family-friendly nastiness! When a massive movie franchise comes to a close, often a hole can develop in the highly competitive market of Hollywood blockbuster filmmaking. Perhaps never before has that hole been as large as the abyss left by the HARRY POTTER series, given the rapid release schedule of those films. It's 2012, and there's no new POTTER. Some might argue that the TWILIGHT series fills the void, yet not only is that franchise little more than a punchline to all but the hardcore fans, it too is set to (hopefully) wrap up this year. Enter THE HUNGER GAMES, seemingly a sure thing based on the POTTER formula: hugely successful series of young adult novels? Check. Talented cast of young leads and respected character actors as support? Naturally. Large scale production and, crucially, marketing budget? You bet. So is THE HUNGER GAMES worthy of taking up the POTTER mantle?
Amazingly, it might be even better.
While no-one would suggest that THE HUNGER GAMES is the most original new property coming from the Hollywood machine, Lionsgate and director Gary Ross adapt Suzanne Collins' source material in just the right ways, jettisoning un-cinematic elements and focusing on the meat of the story right from the opening frame. Rather than build the world of Panem through tedious exposition and backstory, Ross instead drops us directly into the grim life of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and her journey to the Hunger Games, a perverse spectacle inflicted annually on 24 unfortunate teens. While the POTTER series certainly headed in a darker direction as it went on, THE HUNGER GAMES is horrifically bleak right from the get go, and Ross' decision to show instead of tell, through the use of wonderfully expressive, fluid camera-work, paints an ugly picture indeed. There are so many refreshing elements at work here, with an active, independent, and strong female protagonist and a startling absence of overblown CGI, but it's the nastiness that makes this film unique. Delivering a family appropriate experience while retaining the majority of the violence and unpleasantness of the novel is a delicate proposition which Ross mostly pulls off, but one can't help wondering about the potential for a much harder, R-rated cut of the film. It's an understandable issue to be sure, but an issue nonetheless.
Where THE HUNGER GAMES perhaps doesn't fare so well is in the internal strife faced by Katniss, particularly in regards to potential love interests Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). Collins' novel has much more freedom to explore, and even dwell on, Katniss' emotional state through inner monologue, but given the nature of film, particularly a mainstream blockbuster such as this, much less room is left for introspection, and some of the character dynamics and relationships suffer in comparison. Katniss' independence is unfortunately undercut by the franchise building mentality of the film, setting up an inevitable love triangle to be explored in two potential sequels. That said, she's still a much more positive, appropriate female role model than TWILIGHT's limp and passive Bella Swan, or indeed any young female character in recent memory. THE HUNGER GAMES is an important film at many levels, one which heralds the birth of the next big Hollywood franchise, and if the quality of the first installment is maintained then the sequels can't come soon enough.

THE HUNGER GAMES,An American Battle Royale!
THE HUNGER GAMES,Took a rated R violent book and dumbed it down to P13 to make more money.
THE HUNGER GAMES,"Slow and predictable It goes unsaid that the book is almost always better than the film. This movie is unique in the fact that it is much worse than the book. I'm not a fan of the latest fad of teen literature to begin with, but being a science fiction fan and a lover of the movie Battle Royale, I had high hopes for this. The word ""hype"" doesn't even begin to summarize how much attention and praise this movie has received, and it definitely did not deliver. The lead actress was great and the idea of a bleak future landscape separated into districts to keep the population in check is a great story. But the film didn't tell that story well. We get only flashes of how or why this system game into place or what the ""hunger games"" purpose actually is. It was very slow, very predictable even if you hadn't read the book and had virtually no action. The fight scenes it did have were quick flashes that if combined total two or so minutes of the movie. And don't get me started on the awful CGI of the ""killer dogs"" at the end."
CINDERELLA,"I actually really enjoyed this movie. Sure it's still got some of the dated gooey-ness of the original movie, sure Shrek's impact on savaging the Disney/fairy-tale formula can still be felt years after release, but Cinderella is a beautifully directed and cinematographed; and Kenneth Branagh did this?
Why do films like this exist in today's industry? Well franchising for one thing, and even though films like this are basically products in Disney's pipeline it CAN be well done given that the movie's got a determined director at the helm. And oddly, Branagh, the guy who directed films such as 1996's Hamlet, was just the guy to make Cinderella into a watchable film. It's pretty, has a good cast and has some nice tid-bits of humor here and there. And it's an update on the whole Disney-esque 'happily ever after' thing. Yes the story's the same but it gives some much-needed chemistry to Cinderella's and 'The Prince''s romantic charm. And... it works.
You don't need to be a girl or a gay to like this film; just see it for what it is: a harmless remake of an animation from the 1950s."
CINDERELLA,"Has the original version of the fairy tale gone out of style? This movie has been very poorly understood by the public. Unlike previous films, which seek to rewrite traditional fairy tales or watch them from new perspectives (""Maleficent"", ""Ever After"", or even the animations ""Brave"" or ""Tangled""), this film is the live-action version of the fairy tale in its more traditional version. Therefore, we know the whole story and very little has been changed or added. Any problem? Not for me. I usually like original versions more than any contemporary re-interpretations, but it seems that fairy tales have gone out of style.
One of the criticisms I saw was the Cinderella's passive attitude: the girl was educated under values of kindness and generosity (something our current society no longer knows) and isn't willing to abdicate these principles in adversity. Maybe she think that would betray her mother's memory. For our society, which treats the dead as unknown and the living even worse, such submission and servitude is unacceptable! The oppressed must revolt! Cinderella shouldn't serve the tea, she should take that teapot and stick it in her stepmother's throat! Or should she kick her feet and whine, saying ""I don't do it, I'm sick of it""? If you are reading this and you're also think that Cinderella should revolt, then you're one more who has totally forgotten what a fairy tale is. A fairy tale is not about reality or what we do. It's about moral values and what we should do. And the moral teaching conveyed by this tale is that biblical passage ""turn the other cheek"", that you must have heard in Sunday School if you have frequented it. Cinderella's tale is entirely about this! She had the courage to silently endure her suffering and to forgive those who hurt her and, in the end, her reward was to fall in love with a prince and change her life. Her stepmother's punishment didn't delay: she ended up punished, but not by the person she most offended. Moral of the story: love your enemy and forgive, you will have the reward, sooner or later.
Well, the movie is great and is absolutely true to the original fairy tale, including with regard to costumes and sets, which are beautiful. Unfortunately, CGI is too obvious. I would have preferred realistic sets in proper locations rather than the green screen, which should be used with more caution. I have seen some criticism about the large neckline of Cinderella's dress but, in the historical period in which the tale was set (19th century), the ball dress were usually very low-cut. But don't complain! We see women with even fewer clothes on our streets today and we find it natural! Lily James and Cate Blanchett are the main actresses of the film and it is their work (as stepmother and stepdaughter) that supports the whole plot. Blanchett, unsurprisingly, shone with her usual charm, and the veiled but venomous malice she had bestowed on her character. James is an actress I didn't know but I liked to see, having done her work quite well. It's a young actress, surely this movie isn't going to be the movie of her life, but she left a promise of talent that may come to blossom. Helena Bonham Carter and Stellan Skarsg√•rd also enter the film in supporting roles that their talent makes it seem easy.
This movie will easily please all those who want to watch a movie with the original Cinderella story. It's absolutely the same as the book our grandparents used to delight our childhoods. However, if you've gotten tired of it and prefer a modern version of the story this movie is not for you."
CINDERELLA,"LILY JAMES WAS AWESOME! First of all, Lily James was awesome! Wicked Cate Blanchet damn. Probably one of the best adaptation of disney classic."
CINDERELLA,An enchanting twist on the original...
CINDERELLA,"great film! Love this film! no it is not like the original but it is great in it's own way! The prince is more developed as a character, the step-mother is still great, and Cinderella is great too. I think this Cinderella is more quiet and with that a quiet beauty and strength comes through her and it really shines. I love this movie and I will always love to watch this one and the original one."
CINDERELLA,"Should admire Kenneth Branagh artistic sensibility and courage. It is an enormous task to retell a story, a gentle fairy tale, at that, that has been re-proposed zillion times. The typical Hollywood approach, in the effort of being different, has educated the audience to expecting an increasing dose of violence, crudity, gore and perversions at every remake.
Branagh has chosen to to restore the the tale to the original innocence, an imaginary story of kindness and a little magic, as it was meant to be. I guess he knew this would be much harder than throwing in sensation generating garbage as Hollywood would have dictated, nowadays. And this is the mark of a real artist, with integrity and courage.
The movie retains a rich, impalpable feeling of a fairy tale, that flows naturally and graciously to the expected end. The production is lavish, with great actors and beautiful colors. Even the music is perfect. The choice of the traditional children's song ""Lavender Green"" adds a wonderful touch of real and shows the attention to details employed in the production.
Overall, the movie is wonderful and offers quite a pleasant surprise for adults and children, as well.
For those who have been so critical in reviewing this movies, I may only suggest they keep trying to find a little magic the lurid appeasement of senses that Hollywood prefers to offer to their audiences."
CINDERELLA,"Beautiful portrayal This was well casted and I loved the visual effects of it. The infamous transformation was perfection. I wished there was more Fairy Godmother (Helena Bonham Carter) as she was expectedly fabulous, but her part was disappointingly short."
CINDERELLA,"A beautiful fairy tale The story is still an old story, beautifully dreamy, fashion design and art director praise, Cinderella transformation and dancing two scenes are too beautiful. Blanchett really steals the show, Lily James is also quite cute, Helena has less drama, but what other fairy godmother is as interesting as her."
CINDERELLA,Far bette than the 2021 remake Watch this movie instead of the 2021 one because that one had a horrible cast and the music was bad. This movie although isn't perfect but is great to watch.
CINDERELLA,A perfect remake of the original I don't understand what people expect out a Disney remake of Cinderella. The movie sticks to the story and core ideas of the original. Cinderella was written has a fairytale story and that's exactly what the movie conveys. THIS IS A PERFECT MODERN REMAKE OF THE CLASSIC FAIRYTALE STORY CINDERELLA. And I absolutely enjoyed it.
CINDERELLA,HAVE COURAGE AND BE KIND
CINDERELLA,When The Family Saw Cinderella.
CINDERELLA,A wonderful retelling
CINDERELLA,Bibidi Babibi Boo !!
CINDERELLA,"Unapologetically Sincere Non-musical elaboration of the familiar fairy tale is (at times) teeth-achingly sweet, while remaining unapologetically sincere, warm, & fun. Blanchett chews just the right amount of scenery & James is pure innocence personified. #nitrosMovieChallenge."
CINDERELLA,"Magical! This movie is just magical! The message of the movie genuinely touched my heart and spirit, it was breathtakingly gorgeous! The colors, the cinematography, the costumes just wow and love the music! The only thing i would change is i would love it more if there's singing..Lily James have a very sweet mezzo soprano voice i love her singing ""A Dream is a Wish"" at the end of the movie. And yes The acting was so good i cried like so many times..my fave was Prince Kit and the King's scene,Lily crying when her dress was ripped and the first dance oh god it was magic! and the gown transformation was so epic! The lead actors chemistry is so strong.. i fell in love with them. This movie is so uplifting makes me do kind deeds every time! People saying it was boring have a heart of stone for real. This is Amazing and i can't wait for Beauty and The Beast.. Well done Disney!üíôüòòüíã"
CINDERELLA,"A quite beautiful adaptation of a Disney classic Right now Disney's current trend with their live-action films has been a series of live-action re-imaginings of their animated classics. Obviously this has proved to be a rather polarizing tactic amongst certain fans, namely because they believe that these are intended to replace the original films. Well I can assure you that this ain't the intention. You see the internet has this mentality about remakes that they're supposed to replace the original when that's not the case. Hell, even if they don't end up being very good, the original is not tainted in any way. And that's been the case with Disney's live- action remakes, even the ones that haven't been well-received like the 'Alice' films and 'Maleficent'.
'Cinderella', however, was the first of these remakes to actually be well-received by critics and rightfully so as it truly is a beautiful new adaptation of the story that Disney first told in their 1950 animated classic. The original 'Cinderella' is easily one of my all-time favorites when it comes to Disney's animated films so I was really excited to see this new version and I absolutely loved it. Sure it's basically just the same story as the original but it manages to update it by doing some things better than the original. Namely, the relationship between Ella and the Prince in this version is much more developed compared to the original where they immediately fall in love and only share a few scenes together. Lily James is absolutely fantastic in the role of Ella while Richard Madden proves to be, for lack of a better term, a very charming Prince Charming. Of course the rest of the cast is fantastic as well, from Cate Blanchett's excellent take on Lady Tremaine to Helena Bonham Carter's scene-stealing turn as the Fairy Godmother.
But like the original, the film has gotten some flak from feminists over its title character, Cinderella. The argument is that the character is too passive of a protagonist who only sits around waiting to be rescued. Now this is an argument I've never really agreed with. Sure Cinderella doesn't really do as much compared to some future Disney princesses but there's more to her than that. She really deserves credit for being able to put up with all of the crap she gets thrown her way by her evil stepmother and stepsisters. The film very much maintains the theme of encouraging people to 'have courage and be kind'. And let's face it folks... those are good words to live by in today's age.
Like I said before, these Disney remakes aren't replacing the originals. They're just here to serve as interesting new takes on their original source material. And as much I know I'm going to get a lot of flak for this by those who are opposed to the remakes... I think this new Cinderella is better than the original. Don't get me wrong the original is still an animated masterpiece but as a whole I feel that Kenneth Branagh delivered a fantastic adaptation that both reflects the original while also being its own thing."
CINDERELLA,"Cinderella Verizon 20.15 (Flash Review)
This 2015 version is a high quality and modern faithful telling of the classic tale. Stellar visual effects, striking cinematography, lavish costumes and opulent sets complimented with the fun magical transformation scenes make this a pleasant viewing. The acting was solid as well. This production will hold up to rewatching with your children. It does the original justice."
CINDERELLA,"Lily was cute I think Lily suits this role very well.
It was average as a movie. I don't know if this movie was necessary, but it was enjoyable."
CINDERELLA,"A beautiful timeless classic I believe its fair to say that when referring to the classic princess fairytale films, there's only one metric you need to measure, is it swoon worthy? And boy does this one do the trick. A world where good will always prevail, where one only marries for love, what's not to love?
Why isn't this a solid 10 then you may ask. Well it's because there's nothing really impressive about it. This film is great, but far from perfect. With few but glaring oddities (infrequent awkward dialogue and weird camera angles) a 10 is more than its worth. But hey, chances are if you're watching a Disney Princess film, you're not there to critique the film but just want a feel good film to melt thy hearts. So for that, it's a solid 10."
CINDERELLA,"Wonderful! The cinematography, the lines, the stepmother, the stepsisters, the mother, the father, the prince, the chief, and of course Ella. Eveything is sooo good! That one line from the movie became one of my favorites. Must watch!"
CINDERELLA,"Stepmother portrayed with modern depth Although this is about the stepmother, I want to first say that I found all the characters well portrayed and supported by an excellent script, cinematography, and of course a great director. I scanned some of the user reviews and for all those giving a very low rating it seems to me that they missed the essence of Cinderella - it is not supposed to be an action nor hard/boiled tale that apparently even some children want today and should not become such.
I particularly appreciated the stepmother's portrayal because it included clear justification for her anger and bitterness. Not to say given that justification she was correct to have done what she did. But a worthy lesson for us and particularly for children.
The specific scene I am referring to is when she overhears her husband telling his daughter how much he misses her mother, i.e., where is the love and support she desires - a more modern understanding of the difficulty of joining an existing family. This and other related scenes gives the stepmother a depth that makes her more real in place of the one-dimensional cartoon version - but what a joy that version was for me many years ago."
CINDERELLA,"Magical Without thinking too much about the animated original, this film was truly magical. Cinderella was never a favourite of mine, but this new version certainly is. The step-mother was given depth and background to her character. All the acting was brilliant. The story had emotion and had me in tears a number of times. It was just sweet and beautiful. Warmed my heart."
CINDERELLA,"very beautiful film I saw this film yesterday with my family and I have to say that it was magical. I thought that it could be boring because the story of Cinderella is always the same, but even though the story was basically identical to the original one we really enjoyed it and we loved spending time together watching this film."
CINDERELLA,"Disney Excels Again My disappointment was hearing that critics had found fault with this work of perfection.
The characterisation has been thought through carefully and the temptation to make caricatures of the step-mother and her daughters consciously resisted.
The retelling of ""Cinderella"" (apparently known, in the 19th century, as ""Cinderslut"") with the benefits of modern techniques and processes is impeccable.
Often, films that are 'great works' suffer from some minor weakness or other, a detail not followed through, a hasty bit of editing, a clipped or overly long scene but never did I feel that could be said about Disney's film. ""TLC"" (tender loving care"") from beginning to end.
True to Walt's original intentions, here is a film for all the family (well, some teenagers may want to wait a little).
Good luck, it's great to see memorable films making it to our screens."
TITANIC,"How many times I watch this movie.... It's still the masterpiece. I have watched Titanic how many times I don't know. Everytime I watch it, I still cry, laugh, smile, and feel. The story flows with tension throughout the movie; two actors' acting and chemistry need applaud; Sinking ship is realistically filmed; 'My Heart Will Go On' is perfect fit for Jack and Roses' love story and is timeless as well. All the movie's factors are fully qualified. What more can I say? It is the masterpiece."
TITANIC,"STANDING OVATION! - (10 stars out of 10) The stage curtains open ...
Not since the advent of the 1995 film, ""Braveheart"", have I ever been as enthralled or emotionally invested into a movie as I was with ""Titanic"". I knew going in, just from the trailer and word-of-mouth, it was going to be good, but I had no idea the ride I was in for when the lights dimmed in the theater that night. I have never understood (and still don't understand) the negative backlash that I've read/heard when it come to this epic film. Because, it is just that - epic in every way, shape or form.
We follow along as a young wayfarer named Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) wins a ticket to board the Titanic in a game of chance. During its fateful voyage, he meets and falls for an upper-class girl named Rose (Kate Winslet). Under the thumb of her demanding fiance (Billy Zane) and her narrow-minded mother, Rose is introduced to a different side to life by Jack, and he helps her to find her own individuality and independence, alienating her from a life that she already despises. She must now decide if she'll choose to stay where she is, or leave and have a life with Jack - a decision that is further compounded when the mighty ship strikes an iceberg leading to the eye popping conclusion.
What makes this film work is the love story. A lot of the negative reviews I've read complain because there is a love story. But, without it, this movie doesn't work. I am not interested in watching a biography about the Titanic, I want a good story - and this movie certainly delivers that. I was completely invested in Jack and Rose, and when the ship began to sink, I was with them both every step of the way.
I highly recommend this movie at 10 stars out of 10. The event of the ship sinking alone was awe inspiring. You are right there in the scene. I could not take my eyes off the screen. The direction is tight, the special effects phenomenal, and the acting completely believable. DiCaprio and Winslet had perfect chemistry. I was affected and moved by ""Titanic"". And even knowing the outcome, I will happily get on board again and again."
TITANIC,Great
TITANIC,"Despite a lot of plot flaws and conveniences, this really is one of the best films ever made. Ah, yes, the film that propelled Leonardi DiCapro to super stardom, became the first film to gross $1 billion, and stayed on the top of the box office charts for 12 years (only to be kicked off the top by another James Cameron film, Avatar).
It is said 'Titanic' is the film with the most continuity errors of all films. Despite this, though, the film was indeed a masterpiece. The sheer scale of the sets and entire production were simply mind blowing! The sinking of the Titanic was the greatest ship sinking scene EVER and was done with such meticulous detail that one would think they actually really sunk the ship. Off course, that was not the case, though, as it were all (very elaborate) sets, most of which were destroyed during the making of the film.
Leonardo made for a very likable hero, quite frankly one a lot of guys can relate to. The young lovers were so different and yet so alike, and their love story was almost endearing. I must admit, the jumping backwards and forwards in time was a bit unnecessary and resulted in an overlong epic. They should only have told the 1912 story. Apart from that, the film was thrilling, exciting and fascinating in every sense of the word!"
TITANIC,Actually it got better for me
TITANIC,This was one of the few movies that actually brought me to tears.
TITANIC,"As perfect a cinematic experience as you're ever likely to get ""Based on the tragedy that spawned thousands of heartbreaking true stories, comes this fake one."" It's time to decide: was it insensitive and somewhat cheap of James Cameron to throw two made-up passengers who fall in love onto the ship? Or did these two characters offer the audience an anchor to hold onto as we are guided through the dreadful events of April 15th, 1912? Without a doubt, the latter. The fictional story of Jack and Rose never distracts from the tragic true story, it cinematically enhances it. We never ever miss the bigger picture.
First of all, just look at this film. The resplendent wonder of the film's set design, both interior and exterior, places you right on board. It looks and feels the part. And when the inevitable disaster strikes, Cameron grabs onto you and drags you through each painful moment in striking detail. The sinking of the Titanic is brought to life with exquisite attention to detail and astonishing visual effects. It makes for the greatest disaster scenes in any movie I've seen.
However, a Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay film this is not, as Cameron never allows the spectacle to distract us from the agony of it. Watching the Titanic being destroyed is not fun or, in its broadest sense, exciting - it's intensely distressing. Unlike most disaster films, it never feels like we're watching a crowd of extras on a film set flailing around. The lead up to the iceberg strike engages you so convincingly in the period, such that each person in front of the camera has been imbued with rich character. And when the ship sinks, it genuinely shocks you to see them go. For a good part of the sinking, Jack and Rose's fictional plight is quite sensibly placed to one side, giving us time to reflect on the truth and how it would have felt to be aboard the ship that horrifying night.
So aside from its sweeping spectacle and moving depiction of real-life tragedy, what does the story of Jack and Rose bring to the table? In spite of how persuasive the film is, one must remember - it's ultimately a work of fiction, not a documentary. Like any period drama, it is an interpretation of how society worked at the time. Jack and Rose, as well as being beautifully played by DiCaprio and Winslet, are incredibly well crafted. They are a window into a much more subtle form of racism, which is still prevalent today. It's called class, and in the latter half of the movie, it becomes a tool with which to decide who lives and who dies.
Titanic has pretty much anything you can ask for. It's a romance; it's a disaster movie; it's an action film; it's got a sense of humour and wit; it's a period drama; it's a tragedy. Summed up, Titanic is about as perfect a cinematic experience as you're ever likely to get."
TITANIC,"Timeless Titanic is a true masterpiece and is easily one of the greatest films in history. James Cameron has outdone himself with this epic film that is clearly one for the ages. It is perfect in almost every way and can be watched over and over again. From the directing, beautiful photography and an immortal song by Celine Dion. Not only is a masterful depiction of the sinking of the Titanic but a great love story. Romance is my lowest rated genre so it takes a really well made love story for me to like it and Titanic showcased this. Worthy of all its Oscars and revenue this film has etched itself as one of the great triumphs of cinema. It is loved universally and it is truly timeless."
TITANIC,"One of a Kind To all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue, the budget, the this and the that....who wants to hear it? IF you missed the point of this beyond-beautiful movie, that's your loss. The rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think. I am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one stands in its own entity, in my book. It was not supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night. It is the most amazing love story ever attempted. I know that it is the cynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on. Someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money! How lame is that? It made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet, and is the top grossing film in the planet. I will gladly side with the majority this time around. Okay, cynics, time to crawl back under your rock, I am done."
TITANIC,"My review is this film's 2400th....so what more can I say?! ""Titanic"" won a bazillion Oscars and is considered a classic by many. And, it now (counting this one) has 2400 reviews. So, what more can I say about this film that hasn't already been said? Well, very little--that is why this review is rather short.
I give the film a 9 because it isn't perfect. Some of the characters, to me, seemed a bit simplistic. But, no matter if you like them or not, there's no denying the awesomeness of the film. After all, it looks like you are on a huge cruise ship and the special effects of the wreck (this isn't exactly a spoiler!) are amazing. So, like the story or not, the film is staggering to watch--particularly on a big screen. And, now that I think about this, this is exactly how I viewed director Cameron's other huge success, ""Avatar"". Well worth seeing once."
TITANIC,"In retrospect, we were all too hard on this film If you're a Millennial like me, you probably experienced the phenomena known as 'Titanic-mania' during your childhood, where everyone was obsessed with this movie. It was in theatres for almost a year, and every girl between 8-20 was obsessed with Leonardo DiCaprio. Titanic was everywhere in the late 1990s, and because of its popularity and reputation as a gushy romance movie popular with teenage girls, it attracted a lot of hate. Despite winning numerous Oscars, Titanic, for the longest time, had a negative reputation, especially among men.
In hindsight, if you had your image of Titanic shaped by the negative media landscape surrounding it in the late 90s to the 2000s, I highly suggest you give it another go. It really is a wonderful film, and it's enjoyable and fun even if you're a guy. The special effects are second to none, the acting is great and James Horner's soundtrack is absolutely majestic. Even the love story itself, while a bit gushy in parts, is actually quite sweet and endearing. Both Rose and Jack are full realized, strong characters who you care about.
My advice, especially to 20-30 something year old men who were told all their life that 'Titanic sucks', is to give it a chance. You're sleeping on not only a great drama, but a great action movie as well."
TITANIC,A Superb Epic
TITANIC,"Don't get the low rating The low rating makes no sense to me at all... This movie is magnificent, so well made, the acting is superb. Anything below 9 doesn't do it any justice."
TITANIC,"Greatest movie of all time Flawless, enchanting, riveting, wondrous, totally out of this world. Astounding as this may sound, I've just now got around to watching ""Titanic,"" 23 years on, and I'm staggered at all that I've missed my whole life.
Young love is the most wonderful theme to explore in a movie, but it's also the most difficult to depict beautifully and without too much cloying treacle. Couple that with the story of a young teenage girl in the bygone era of aristocrat families and arranged marriage, side saddles and corsets, outrageous class inequality and rich powerful men in control of everything and keeping women under their thumbs - and you get ""Titanic."" And James Cameron, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet cracked it with a bang! They impressed. They dazzled. They shined.
They took our breath away."
TITANIC,"Amazing in 1997, 2005, 2015, 2030, 3010 & forever more a Masterpiece! You can watch this movie in 1997, you can watch it again in 2004 or 2009 or you can watch it in 2015 or 2020, and this movie will get you EVERY TIME. Titanic has made itself FOREVER a timeless classic! I just saw it today (2015) and I was crying my eyeballs out JUST like the first time I saw it back in 1998. This is a movie that is SO touching, SO precise in the making of the boat, the acting and the storyline is BRILLIANT! And the preciseness of the ship makes it even more outstanding!
Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio definitely created a timeless classic that can be watched time and time again and will never get old. This movie will always continue to be a beautiful, painful & tragic movie. 10/10 stars for this masterpiece!"
TITANIC,"HOW CAN YOU RATE THIS FILM LOW? This is just a record breaker and you can see why. Even to this day I find anything Titanic related really interesting,. Such a great movie."
TITANIC,"Every time I see this movie.... I wake up in the middle of the night with total anxiety.
While the fictional story line is fairly cliche and some of the characters are a little cringe (Bill Paxton's hair and earring, for example), the truth is this: 1,517 people died horrible deaths in the icy Atlantic in the dead of night. That eats at me constantly. I think of some of them being all cozy in their beds, happily dreaming of going to America, and suddenly they are waken by the rumbling of the iceberg hit, by the alarms, by the sounds of rising panic and the unbelievably coldness of the weather and water. It saddens me to this day.
I caught the movie yet again while channel surfing and sure enough, I stopped and ended up watching the last 90 minutes. The recreation of the sinking is amazing and horrifying. The details presented put you right there. I always put myself in that situation mentally and I wonder what would have become of me. No one can truly know until it actually happens. I think about the cold more than anything. I have been in very cold places before, but never getting soaking wet in that cold. The people who ended up alive in the water went through a horrible hell for a few minutes then hypothermia drifted them off to their deaths. It's haunting to think about. I woke up around 3am after having a dream I was in icy water, trying to catch my breath, trying to stay afloat, and not doing very well at either. The anxiety level increased as I began to wake up and I got mad at myself for watching the movie right before going to bed!
My thoughts go out to those souls who perished on the Titanic and I hope beyond hope that there is a better place they went to."
TITANIC,Titanic masterpiece: an emotional and visual thrill ride
TITANIC,"This Film Brought Me To Tears I am still crying as I am writing this review as of right now. I don't even know where to begin. I can now see why this film was one of the highest grossing movies of all time. The blending of genres was masterfully done through the style of a Historical Romance/Drama, and a Disaster/Action film. The writing was absolutely superb, for a 3 hour movie I found myself completely engaged not even blinking my eye. The costumes, music, performances, characters, cinematography, dialogue was so magical I can't even put words here to describe the beauty of everything put into this movie. The performances just take your breathe away. Jack and Rose's love story is so full of life and heart and what true love should be even if it's a battle or your not the same class and can't be together ounce you find your soulmate that's what love is about. Their characters felt so human and that really is what puts this movie at a whole new level. The camerawork is some of the best I have ever seen in any film. I don't even want to spoil how thrilling, chilling, beautifully well done the Titanic sinking part of the film is because it is something you just have to see for yourself and experience the devastating heartbreaking tragedy that occurred. James Cameron you are and will always be one of the best filmmakers to ever live and this is your ultimate masterpiece."
TITANIC,"the ultimate lovestory Titanic is the film ive viewed 2nd most of all, i am the kinda guy that can watche a good movie once every 2 to 3 months, and ive seen titanic some 25-30 times and i should know the storyline pretty well.
when seeing this in the theater first time alone and the next night with my wife i was lost for words each time. my wife cried the whole night and well into the next night of this lovestory, and whenever i put this in the video, i know ill have the tv space for myself, cause she made a promise to never ever let herself into a mental state again as when watching it the first time.
its not so much the act that does this film, its far too cliched' to become a marvel of acting, but its the heart and the cruelty of life and death that crushes my heart each time i see it. the last 15 minutes are the worst, and i usually stop when the flag goes below the surface of the ocean..
the grumpy old man might be a cry-baby, but its worth it, the second highest on my ever best movie list"
TITANIC,"One for the Ages This movie re-wrote film history in every way. No one cares what anyone thinks about this movie, because it transcends criticism. Every flaw in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has going for it. It is an extremely beautiful movie, and I doubt many of us will see anything like it again. I've seen it more times than I care to count, and I still become transfixed every time, with a feeling which is hard to describe. One for the ages."
TITANIC,"One of many movies and many stories from the ship of dreams, but still floats at the top of the list."
TITANIC,James Cameron's Titanic is a masterpiece and a tour de force of filmmaking
TITANIC,"Haunting, Powerfully Resonant And Visually Stunning"
TITANIC,Why low score? People are crazy. They rate Avengers so high and they rate this masterpiece low? This is beyond absurd. You guys should encourage great filmmakers like this one not stupid ones like the super hero franchises. For the love of god.
TWILIGHT,"Undeniably Atmospheric There's an atmosphere to Twilight and that much you simply cannot deny. I can't help but be engrossed by the way that this movie captures the beauty, dreariness and nature of the Pacific Northwest. A memorable score and soundtrack heighten Catherine Hardwicke's broody, yet still enchanting tone. Elliot Davis' cinematography under her direction replicates the indie flair prominent in her other features, this is what separates it apart from the commercially realised sequels that followed. It's a hot and cold, gothic romance with just enough high stakes to enchant you until the very end. If it's raining, you can best believe that I'm slipping into something comfortable and putting Twilight on."
TWILIGHT,"Guilty pleasure If I saw the movie now for the first time I know I probably will hate it, but the 11 year old me was so love struck with it. Honestly no movie these days makes me this happy anymore. Also I think this one (the first movie) is so much cinematically pleasing. I enjoy the dark blue rainy vibe & the shaky camera a lot. This movie is my guilty pleasure. 10 for the nostalgia feelings."
TWILIGHT,"The Lost Boys & Girls... What would you do, if a vampire captures you, sends your heart into a spin, vessels bursting out your skin, only drawback is he's keen, to suck the life out of your spleen, though he'll hold back at his leisure, to ensure you get your pleasure, competition soon arrives, puts your man in overdrive, all the passion and the gory, to lay claim to all your glory."
TWILIGHT,"Twilight! Twilight! Oh, my... Twiiiiiiiiliaaaaaaaaaaght! That was my interpretation of this weekend that I had to endure working at my movie theater, all these little hormone crazed brace wearing under developed young girls who I think would've just about died with the anticipation of seeing Twilight, I'm not kidding, I personally witnessed a twelve year old say that she wanted to have Robert Pattinson's baby. OK, so how I saw the movie, my sister, ironically my older sister has been just raving about the Twilight series with her friends and told me that I have to read these books, after weeks of bugging me with it, I finally broke down and read them. Actually it's kind of a fun series, it reminded me of the same love that I had for the TV series Buffy the vampire Slayer when I was a young teen. But of course she has to take me to the midnight premiere with 100,000 crazed fans who were knocking each other down and crawling all over each other just to see a movie.
Bella Swan has always been a little bit different, never caring about fitting in with the trendy girls at her Phoenix high school. When her mother remarries and sends Bella to live with her father in the rainy little town of Forks, Washington, she doesn't expect much of anything to change. Then she meets the mysterious and beautiful Edward Cullen. Intelligent and witty, he sees straight into her soul. Soon, Bella and Edward are swept up in a passionate and decidedly unorthodox romance. Edward can run faster than a mountain lion, he can stop a moving car with his bare hands - and he hasn't aged since 1918. Like all vampires, he's immortal. But he doesn't have fangs, and he doesn't drink human blood.
So, my opinion about Twilight the movie... honestly, it's average, it's my junior high romance with a vampire. I hate, beyond hate to say this, I'm a hypocrite for saying this, but because I read the book before I saw the movie, I had this completely different interpretation of what the characters look like and how they say certain lines. Twilight the movie made me laugh more than anything simply because of the actors, Robert and Kristen are not bad actors, but the way they talked, I just couldn't take their ""love"" seriously. Peter Facinelli who played Carlisle Cullen, Edward's father, was exactly how I pictured and pulled in the best performance of the film. Is it worth the watch, absolutely if you're a fan of the books, otherwise, I would say if you just wanna see this movie, I recommend the matin√©e price because honestly, I think I may have lost my hearing after this weekend of the none stop screams from crazed teens.

TWILIGHT,Twilight
TWILIGHT,"So bad it's ALMOST good. NOTE: This review is the fair and unbiased opinion of someone with extremely little knowledge of the Twilight series. I watched the movie with a few die hard fans who I talked to after the movie, and I will work some of their thoughts into the review.
Another much loved book series has been brought to life in the form of Twilight, which despite having nothing in common with the Harry Potter series, will undoubtedly draw comparisons because of the furor and craze surrounding it. The main difference between the two, however, is that the Harry Potter films are generally good and solid films. Twilight, despite having done a couple things right, is not.
As a story, I will admit, Twilight is very catchy and interesting. Now I see what all the hype is about. If I was a young girl, I would go nuts over this stuff too. It's not just a vampire and a human falling in love with each other, but because of the two leads, it's one of the best on screen romances of the decade. This, however, is severely hurt by the fact that Twilight boasts easily some of the worst writing and editing I've ever seen. Let's not forget about the horrid VFX and pasty makeup, either. It's one of the cheesiest films of the year, and can definitely be put in the category of ""so bad it's ALMOST good"". Yes, I just invented that category.
The 'allure' of the film appears to be the character played by Robert Pattinson, who ironically was previously known for his role in the Harry Potter series. Pattinson succeeded there and he more than succeeds again, as he more than fit the bill for what he needed to do with the character. Most actors would believe the only requirement of the character is to be good looking, but Pattinson takes it a step further and makes Edward Cullen very likable, trustworthy, and in the end, a good hero for the audience. Kristen Stewart is sort of the queen of not showing facial expressions, so she's perfect for the role of the awkward teen Bella Swann. However, there were sometimes where her lack of emotion bothered me.
Our supporting players...Well, none of them are noteworthy like Pattinson is. The villain of the film is lame, cheesy, and played by an actor I can't take seriously. Nikki Reed is probably the best as Rosalie, Edward's 'sister', and the antagonistic vibe felt from her adds a different side to the movie.
Okay, I don't really know what possessed the writer of this screenplay to make it so horrible (was it the source material?), because the dialog is just so bad that I laughed at serious moments. There's a lot of intentional humor, mostly in the beginning when Bella and Edward feel like awkward teens in love. I guess the movie moved along okay, because I wasn't bored at all. I was either laughing at how stupid the dialog was, laughing at some of the mildly funny jokes, or getting pulled in by the electric chemistry between Stewart and Pattinson.
That, folks, is the reason most people will be able to sit through this movie. The chemistry between the two leads, romantically and sexually, is amazing. In this respect, Pattinson and Stewart are perfectly cast and it makes me wonder if they could end up together in real life some day. I was very surprised by how much I liked seeing their one on one scenes, as cheesy and bad as the VFX and editing are.
As far as these visual effects go, I've seen a few vampire movies in my day. I'm going to assume director Catherine Hardwicke has seen a few. Well, she needs to watch a few more. Her fight scenes are horribly choreographed, terribly shot, and lack the intensity required to successfully rouse her audience. I could almost notice the wires the actors flew across on. I noticed a ton of errors with the editing as well, such as basic stuff like mouths moving and no words coming out, and words coming out when no mouths were moving. The fight scene at the end has wicked bad editing too, as the sound mixing also suffers as well.
All in all, with Twilight, as bad a movie as it may be, I couldn't help but stay interested in it because of the electric chemistry between the leads. That alone kept me in the seat the whole time. It is technically one of the worst films of the year, but the entertainment factor in the above respect keeps it out of the company of movies like Disaster Movie and College. I was actually lucky to see it with some of the fans of the book, and all of them (5) described the movie as a 'disappointment' and that the film went 'half way' with some subplots, either starting and dropping them, or randomly starting them halfway through an individual subplot. They were not happy at all with this movie, but agreed on one thing: Robert Pattinson was the perfect Edward Cullen. I'll agree with them on all those points and say that Twilight is exactly what I thought it would be: so bad it's ALMOST good."
TWILIGHT,Pretty Good for What They Had to Work With
TWILIGHT,"the SOUNDTRACK is amazing This movie deserves an 8 purely for the soundtrack - one of the best movie sound tracks EVER (in my opinion) and beautiful scenery and cinematography. sure, the acting isn't great, nor is the script writing, however this movie is an enjoyable watch and a romance classic"
TWILIGHT,"Like it or not, the relevance cannot be denied"
TWILIGHT,"Vampiric romance lacks real 'bite' After the enormous flurry of attention Stephanie Meyer's literary series attracted (a unique hybrid of Romeo and Juliet style teenage angst and hormonal lust and supernatural horror), a cinematic adaptation seemed not only inevitable but almost expected, providing sultry visuals to the tale of starstruck lovers and proving the definitive date movie for months to come. However, the curse of mainstream literary adaptations proves inescapable, with excitement surrounding the release leading to the film being somewhat unreasonably over-hyped. And while Twilight is hardly a complete failure of a film by any standards, there remains the inescapable sense of its existence being geared to match up to a set standard rather than simply aiming to succeed as a film, making for the overall result being uniformly disappointing, whether for fans of the source material or those unfamiliar with the novels.
Few Hollywood productions have the concern of appealing to both the demographics flocking to romances and supernatural action films, and as such, the impression is frequently given of Twilight biting off more than it can chew. This indecision between concentrating on the supernatural or romantic facets of the film leads to one of the more glaring flaws of the picture - the sense of neither being devoted enough focus to truly excel. While the climactic battle is gruesomely effective, for the most part, the film's special effects appear rushed, under-budgeted and just plain sloppy, coasting by on horrendously unconvincing slow motion to represent vampire super-speed and making moments which should have been filled with wonder and awe instead evoke unintentional laughs and groans. However, Meyer's revisionist take on vampire lore is intriguing, and the viewer wishes the film had delved into the technical aspects of immortal vampire lifestyles further - a sequence where protagonist Bella slowly begins to suspect the true identity of the mysterious boy she has found herself involved with is impressively eerie and chilling. Such moments are aided incalculably by the tremendous musical score of Carter Burwell, whose bold mix of brassy Gothic themes and eerie, chilling motifs perfectly compliments the intensity of the film.
However, Twilight's main concern lies in its script, which boasts some particularly gruesome patches of dialogue apart from the general lack of characterisation one has sadly grown to expect from the teen romance genre. Similarly, despite director Catherine Hardwicke appearing to be the perfect candidate to helm such a film (with directorial debut Thirteen demonstrating a keen knowledge of the teenage girl mentality), her handling of the source material is unfortunately shaky.The film repeatedly falls prey to the ""Harry Potter syndrome"", feeling somewhat clunky in its almost robotic adherence to its source material, giving it the sense of jumping awkwardly from plot point to plot point and lacking the necessary cohesion and narrative flow.
But most importantly, for a film revolving around its central romantic attraction and sexual tension, the audience is never really given the chance to FEEL the romance, to be drawn in by the mutual lust and entrapment of the two leads for one another. In an oddly rushed sequence, the budding romance between protagonists Bella and Edward is reduced to a couple of nonchalant sessions of hanging out, mostly demonstrated through montage, after which Bella's (largely unnecessary) narration declares her unequivocal love for Edward. This rather abrupt transition would toe the line of appearing satirical of teenage romance were it not for the fact that the viewer realises the moment is meant to be completely heartfelt. What was likely far more effective in literary form, with the chance to understand Bella's emotions and mental process making the romance far more credible does not translate into film. As such, with this crucial central romance lacking the necessary spark which made the novel such a success, Twilight, for all of its periodic cinematic potential, just feels somewhat unnecessary.
The film's casting is perfectly passable, supplying a sufficient variety of up and coming pristine teenage beauties capable of essaying their character types, yet for a book which was driven by such genuine intensity and passion, one can't help thinking of all the performances as somewhat listless and flat. While Kristen Stewart makes a passable romantic lead as headstrong Bella, she lacks the necessary charismatic spark to truly make the viewer warm to her, making her teenaged-angst interludes harder to empathise with. Robert Pattinson does his best as teenage dreamboat vampire Edward, sharing strong chemistry with Stewart, even if his ""sultry, moody glances"" delve into the melodramatic to the point of verging on comical at times. The rest of the cast give rather bland but serviceable performances, the standouts being Cam Gigandet who is mercifully given the chance to gleefully chomp on scenery and generate sufficient menace as sadistic villainous vampire James and Ashley Greene who essays the ideal balance of being sweetly charming without being overly chirpy as Edward's kind-hearted sister Alice. However, despite his best efforts, Billy Burke is forced to wade through ""stern but absent father"" clich√©s to the point of being almost invisible as Bella's emotionally stunted parental figure, and Taylor Lautner fares little better as mysterious prospective love interest Jacob.
While Twilight is hardly a failure on all fronts, with a sporatic peppering of effective moments, the word which most ably describes the film as a whole is 'passable', lacking the necessary intensity or impact to truly hit home. It is easy to envision the adaptation being far more satisfying if done as a smaller, independent production outside the shadow of Hollywood, one which would not shy away from capturing the true passion and intensity of the central relationship without baulking at the prospect of a simmering yet sexless teenage relationship. As is, Hardwicke's film is content to succumb to clich√© and sloppy, complacent storytelling, making it far too 'bloodless' to truly satisfy.

TWILIGHT,"Full of memories. The music is great, I still listen to linkin park songs over and over again, the story was really popular.Watching this movie again, full of memories."
TWILIGHT,Teenage Vampire Romance At Its Dullest
TWILIGHT,"No fangs? Sunlight doesn't hurt? Oh, this MUST be a vampire film! 'Twilight' was one of the most hilarious movies I've seen in awhile; at least that's how it started. Reminding me a lot of 'The Happening,' I found myself laughing out loud during the first half and then simply hating life during the last half. I have heard this was meant for teenage girls. Fine, I get it and I'm not one. However, how I wish more for them. They deserve so much more. It's absolutely no wonder why this movie dropped its audience 62% on weekend 2. There are so many points to cover for this two-hour tragedy, I'll at least attempt to cover the incredibly bad aspects: awful, laugh-out-loud acting and dialogue/narration, horrible soundtrack, special effects were downright amusing, the bad (""Johnny Suede"") hairdos and the desperate attempts at a franchise ¬ñ let's just set up every scene to set the stage for the inevitable part II, III, etc. I'm just going to assume the people playing the parts (it's too nice to call them actors) read the original material. Well, the ""I can't live without you"" wooden dialogue seems like they are seriously reading from the book rather than playing the parts. And one of the worst aspects of this film was the fact that after all the lovey-dovey stares, (oh, God, the constant stares Bella and Edward give each other. STOP, please, God, STOP!) they seemed to forget one of the most basic elements in any plot ¬ñ the adversary. OK. Well, let's introduce one 3/4s into the film in the shape of Brad Pitt. Why does he want Bella? To get back to the family? Why? Oh, I guess I'll have to wait for Part II. And yes, I plan on waiting in line for that film. I'm always in the mood for a good laugh or dozen."
TWILIGHT,Really Grew on Me...
TWILIGHT,"Sparkly vampires & one awful leading lady = a film that's tough to watch I'm about as far from this movie's demographic as you can get (I'm no 12-year-old girl), but in the interests of vampire cinema I forced myself to sit through this film in the hope of somehow enjoying it. Of course, I was bitterly resulted by what I saw, which is nothing more than an angsty teen romance that tries, and fails, to be a hip vampire movie. Vampire movies have long contained simmering sexuality ‚Äì Chris Lee positively exuded it in his Hammer outings ‚Äì but the theme is reduced to a superficial level in this film, as vampirism is just yet another problem ‚Äì like acne and the in-crowd ‚Äì that our young lovers have to deal with.
The movie's po-faced efforts to tell this story seriously (I mean, you want me to take sparkling vampires seriously?) make it all the worse. The overly familiar plot never once attempts to bring anything new to the table, and the late-stage introduction of a supposed villainous character is a real fail. The film's nadir has to be the baseball set-piece, in which a family of vampires use their supernatural skills to beat the opposing team. Cinema doesn't get much more embarrassingly bad than this.
Then again, if sullen teenage heroines with faces you want to slap (Kristen Stewart, I'm talking about you) are your thing, and your have a penchant for spiky-haired loners in white makeup, then by all means give it a go. You never know, you might even enjoy it. Unlike me."
TWILIGHT,Didn't Know Vampires Need Public Education!
TWILIGHT,"Why was this movie made? Some movies are so good that they are talked about, often quoted and thought of almost with reverence decades after their first release. Twilight is not one of those movies. Twilight is fluff, utterly forgettable, and gives cause to wonder why anyone would want to make this movie in the first place. This movie is so nondescript and so devoid of anything that is even remotely interesting that calling it a bad movie would give it too much credit. In times past this movie would have been assigned to the B portion of a double feature and be given little if any notice. The story contains certain interesting features but at no time does it make any dramatic impact worth noting. The movie may work as escapist fare if you feel like going to the movies to take a nap, but given the high price of tickets today, that is not an advisable option. So if you feel like taking a nap, go watch this movie when it comes out on a DVD or better yet when it is shown on network television at which time you can start watching it and then go to sleep in the comfort of your own home."
TWILIGHT,"I can appreciate what this wanted and tried to be. To say that 'Twilight' carries baggage is a dire understatement. The books' reputation precedes them, carrying questionable writing and strong themes of abusive relationships, and it's impossible to watch the movies in 2022 without being aware of much derided special effects, acting, and more. At the same time, one tries to approach movies with an open mind, and it's important to recognize in the first place that these titles were written for a ""young adult"" audience, and all the horrid awkwardness that immediately greets us with scenes of high school age characters is actually very fitting, for good or ill. And secondly - there are a lot of recognizable performers here that have more than proven their capabilities elsewhere, before or and or since; I think most viewers should be well-rounded enough to recognize that even the best actors, given poor material to work with, will look bad in a lackluster feature.
I don't think 2008 film 'Twilight' is especially great. However, I'm frankly astonished to find myself thinking it's not nearly as bad as everyone has made it out to be in the past 14 years. Here's the thing: all the ham-handedness, the overt and kitschy flourishes, the bluntness - and above all the stilted and gawky writing, acting, and otherwise execution - doesn't feel accidental. It's bewildering as a movie-goer, absolutely, and hard to swallow, and to whatever extent the approach here was intentional, I don't think it was pulled off with all due success. Yet this is a movie about teens, for teens, with supernatural elements forced in, and at the same time that the picture comes across as unnatural and inorganic, nothing actually seems out of place. It's a flummoxing, indelicate balance, distinctly imperfect, and I can't for one moment begrudge anyone who honestly engages with 'Twilight' and dislikes it. For my part, though, speaking as someone who has watched films of all possible styles, genres, quality, value, from silent classics to Asylum mockbusters - I see what this wanted to be, and what it could have been. I can understand and appreciate the ways in which this does work, and those in which it doesn't. If the series were produced not as feature films but as a program on The CW alongside 'Riverdale' or the like, no one would bat an eye. I don't know if it's totally correct to say I like 'Twilight,' but... I get it.
Hair and makeup, costume design, Elliot Davis' cinematography, Nancy Richardson's editing, the visual effects, Catherine Hardwicke's direction, filming locations, set design and decoration, the soundtrack - almost every possible aspect of the production design and art direction, more often than not, is painfully gauche, overdone, and a bit of a burden to bear. That's not to say that it's outright bad; sometimes a particular shot or scene is actually rather fetching, and were more care taken at large I can see where they would have fit in a title of greater repute. Artless as it may sometimes be, it's not sloppy.
Of course, again, much has been made of the acting. To be frank: especially knowing what the cast are capable of, what I see in watching this are actors who worked with what they were given. At risk of repeating myself, the overwhelming awkwardness that pervades the picture from the very start is built into the characters and their interactions, the setting, the scenario, and every little detail, for better or for worse. In a story about young love, new friends, uncertainty, and personal and interpersonal conflict, all the somewhat halting, forced, or artificial expressions, movement, or delivery don't seem entirely wrong - but instead, kind of appropriate. Director Hardwicke has some noteworthy credits to her name, and if occasionally her contribution here is lacking, when it comes to guiding her cast, I think she was rather on point. Once more, it's a very fine line the production walks, an uneasy balancing act of ""just right"" that ever risks slipping into oafish gracelessness. Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, Billy Burke, Nikki Reed, Anna Kendrick, and everyone else on hand did their best with what they had. None of the performances here are great - but by no means do I think they're altogether rotten.
And that leaves the writing. Though I have certainly heard much about Stephanie Meyer's books, I freely admit I haven't read the source material, and I can only make assume that Melissa Rosenberg's screenplay is reasonably faithful. It's worth noting as well that Rosenberg has a considerable number of credits and indeed accolades to her name. The same facets I've described with 'Twilight' broadly certainly apply here, too, as the dialogue and characters vary between tawdrily brusque and direct, inelegantly clumsy and unrefined, and or what feels like is simply suitable. The scene writing, informed by Meyer's own, similarly has some bright spots, while at times struggles with contrivance. However, I also get a sense that this is just one of the difficulties of telling a YA-supernatural romance story; I find it hard to imagine there are many ways of showing scenes of Bella and Edward's blossoming love, or the demonstrations of his powers, that wouldn't come off as strained and cringe-worthy. And the overall narrative has problems in the small details, and above all treads murky territory with the questionably handled overtones of domestic violence and abuse. Yet the bare essence of the tale - a human mingling with ""creatures of the night"" - is classic, with familiar themes, and is no less worthy just because of the high school setting. In the wide strokes, I think the screenplay is just fine.
What I think it all comes down to is that this is a movie that, beyond the presumed target audience of teen girls, is best left for those viewers who are wholly receptive to all the wonderful, weird, wild, or woeful possibilities that cinema has to offer. I genuinely believe that 2008's 'Twilight' is quite far from a bad movie - but I also readily recognize that I say this from a place of having done my best to find the value herein. Apart from the thematic material in regards to relationships, the biggest issue I see are the special effects - done well such as they are, but not considered at the storyboard stage with particular mindfulness. Everything else, from writing, acting, and directing, down to the slightest rounding elements, are ""okay"" or ""apt"" but constantly border on tactless or unsophisticated. For what it tried to do, and be, I think 'Twilight' was more of a success than not, but it tripped over its own two left feet a little bit too much for it not to be noticeable. Color me surprised, though - I can't say I wasn't entertained."
TWILIGHT,"Gag. I give this movie 2 stars. And those 2 stars are not anything to do with the plot, but how BAD it is. It's so bad, it's almost good.
Think of it as a comedy and you'll probably enjoy it. It's hilarious in the way The Room is hilarious. There are plot holes, bad acting and writing, and bad special effects. I was shocked that an actor I had seen actually do a good job (Pattinson) could sink so low. It was like he wasn't even trying.
Honestly, I feel sorry for these actors. This movie is laughably bad and they'll be compared to it for the rest of their lives.
Watch this movie with anti-Twilight fans and expect a fun evening full of laughter. But don't try to compare it to a decent movie."
TWILIGHT,"whoever you are, girl or boy, man or woman, Twilight is shoddy, pretentious film-making Look, whoever-you-are-readers, I'm not a teenage girl. I'm a 20-something gent who just likes watching movies, usually good ones. I can also go for the occasional really stupid/fun bad movie or incredible guilty pleasure. With Twilight, I knew it was, according to what I heard and read and seen about it, *meant* for teenage girls, I suppose, since it's one of those super dated and tried-and-whatever stories of a girl falling for a guy she's not supposed to and bad stuff happens - only with vampires. I can't speak for anyone except myself in saying it simply stating that it's not a good movie. Period.
And it's not just about the treatment of vampires. Sure, there's that. Sure there is the facet of these being diluted and watered down so-called vampires to the point of being nothing but mockable. But it's simply a story that on its own terms is not told well. It's shot through the filter of whiter-blue-shade-of-pale, where the intent, I guess, is to make Washington state (specifically the town of Fork) look like this all the time.
The director, Catherine Hardwicke, has directed some decent films before, such as 2003's Thirteen. But here she tackles the material without any subtlety. The cast, featuring sometimes very-good-actors Kristen Stewart and (yes) Robert Pattinson, seem to be in the kind of ""method* subtlety that comes with that caveat of years of the James Dean in-breeding school of acting. Her camera people roam around without, usually, any sense of placement for the sake of the story, and, well, the story itself reeks of stupidity and consequence in the most mind-boggling of happenstances.
Perhaps there could have been at least a semi-interesting or compelling story here, with an out-of-town girl in a new town meeting a young mysterious man at her high school and falling in love and finding he's a vampire and still being really turned on by it and yada yada bad things happen. Or maybe I'm wishing impossible things. Coming from a book by Stephenie Meyer that is more Harlequin romance than vampire lore, it's central problem is giving us characters not only not likable, but without personality. Say what you will about the corny aspects of Whedon's Buffy the Vampire Slayer, it had characters and story lines that actually meant things, with personalities and humor and real drama that could be affecting. In Twilight the coldness of the environment is reflected quadruple-fold in the characters and story, and the film-making, shoddy as it is, probably reflects that attitude of the book.
Oh, and of course, it's corny poppycock a lot of the time, but again it shouldn't have been a problem. I might have even laughed out loud, for all the wrong reasons, at one of the most unintentionally funny scenes of the decade with the vampire baseball scene (yes, it's as ludicrous and bang-your-head-against-the-wall-till-you-bleed without any point for the story save for a West Side Story stand-off). But aside from its abstinence-only allegory (and believe you me, this is the antithesis of 2008's Teeth), there's nothing here a viewer can take away of worth. Nada. Zilch. There's nothing interesting in the romance because the characters are either boring miscreants, befuddled side characters like Bella's father, or 1/2 dimensional drones like that ""bad"" vampire in the mirrors climax.
And finally, nothing to add significantly to vampire lore, save for its pop culture phenomena. Maybe I'm missing something the teen girls are seeing, maybe there's something oh-so dreamy about that pretentious navel gazer Edward. But a duck is a duck, and Twilight is an overwrought, meddling piece of a twaddle-corpse movie."
TWILIGHT,How is it possible to make a dull vampire movie?
TWILIGHT,"Twilight review Its not great, its not the worst movie either, I liked the cinematography and some of the fight scenes, the acting was good enough, not into the romance or sparkling vampires much but overall not as bad as I thought it would be, so I had a acceptably good time and its one of the stronger movies"
TWILIGHT,"Not a terrible movie but all means, but not exactly my cup of tea I didn't think Twilight was a terrible movie as such, but it is not a fantastic one either. I will admit it wasn't my cup of tea, hence my mixed score, but there are redeeming qualities. I haven't read the book, so I can't judge its faithfulness or lack of to the text. I am going to start with the negatives. The dialogue felt very clunky and awkward, and I honestly felt the actors didn't have that much to work with. The plot takes a very long time to get going, and while it gets going, there were parts that felt underdeveloped sadly. And there were a number of bits towards the beginning that were unintentionally funny, and I think that was to do with Robert Pattinson. He is a real heart-throb I know, but his acting came across as rather hammy and even overdone. When me, my family and my sister's boyfriend saw it at the cinema, there was a lot of laughter at the scenes where the character Edward Cullen was staring into the camera. However, there are some good points. Kristen Stewart does give an assured performance in the lead, and Cam Gigandet does give one of the better performances of the movie. The soundtrack was somewhat decent, the camera work was good on the most part, and the scenery was splendid. Overall, I had mixed feelings on Twilight, it wasn't bad or good, just a little on the average side. It was a vampire movie but without the bite. 5/10 Bethany Cox"
TWILIGHT,"Liberate te ex inferis: save yourself from hell . . . by not watching this. The only reason I never read Twilight when it first came out, long before it was popular, was because I read a book review stating that it was a clich√©d and traditional¬ótwo things that I hate more than anything. The only reason I watched the movie was so I could actually understand what the vast majority of America was talking about when they raved about it. I came with low expectations and an open mind. I reassured myself, after all, I do enjoy love stories when they're original and memorable, so this couldn't be too bad, right? Three hours later, I left the theater feeling as if I was just released from a torture device and struggled desperately to my car on weak legs that just walked through hell on earth. Is my last sentence melodramatic? Maybe, but compared to the cheesy melodrama that IS the plot of Twilight, me sitting through that atrocious movie looks downright life-or-death.
From the first scene to the last, at least 1/3 of every scene in the movie is filled with nothing but characters staring at each other or at various things. I've never thought I would have to sit here and actually type up a complete paragraph complaining about the amount of staring in a movie, but, folks, the day has come. Bella meets Edward: they don't talk, they literally just stare. The vampire plot point is reveled: they stare. Bella is in a life-or-death situation: she stares at whatever is about to kill her. At one point, a car is ready to crush her, and what does she oh-so-realistically do? Stare at it.
The acting is that hilariously bad. During the majority of the movie Bella has a look on her face that is a mix between being high and having an orgasm¬ówhile staring. Edward, despite what the horny pre-teen girls (and middle-aged women) want to believe, is a walking self-parody. Cheesy lines (that he repeats over and over again), unintentionally cheesy lines (""I'm so hot, and that makes me a perfect killer!""), and did I mention he's supposedly hundreds of years old yet he still acts like an angsty-creepy-weird-virgin-guy?
So, how was the story? It's based on a novel, so it has to have a plot, right? Wrong. Put simply, vampire romance is the most unoriginal idea ever to hit literature. Not to mention movies like Near Dark and Let the Right One In already beat the overused plot bloody on the big screen. Essentially, Twilight in one line is: boy and girl fall in love, boy must sacrifice everything for girl as she sits there like a pretty Barbie doll (and Kristen Stewart isn't even much to look at here), then they both commit. And while you're watching it, it seems even less interesting than that. There is zero entertainment value unless you're a hopelessly horny female who humps her pillow with images of Edward in her head, or you're a hopelessly pathetic male who just wants to impress his girlfriend because he can relate to a ""emotional love story"". I can't comment on the former, but, seriously, I'm a guy who likes love stories and this is NOT a love story. It's a traditionalist middle school English essay with flat characters and no plot other than: put two horny kids together, but appeal to the ""dark"" crowd by making it a vampire story . . . without even showing fangs.
Other dishonorable mentions: 1) Twilight = Napoleon Dynamite - the humor + stupid subplots 2) The ""Restrain yourself, Edward, don't suck her blood!"" scene brings unintentional cheese to a new level 3) The movie never ends; two hours seems like eternity (in hell) 4) Baseball doesn't make edge-of-your-seat action 5) There is no action 6) There are no real vampires unless you count pretty-boys 7) Stephanie Myers completely screws up the vampire myths
I almost feel sorry for Catherine Hardwicke. She's an amazing director, and she singlehandedly turned this stupid crap-fest into a well-done movie on a technical level, and everything else was out of her hands. But who would honestly turn down the money this movie would bring in? I don't blame her, I blame Stephanie Myers.
I also feel sorry for the countless people who watch this and think it's a quality love story, thus never being exposed to the true love stories out there. What is Twilight? A horny, unoriginal, childish fantasies put into a movie. That, like always, wins mass reader, and now viewer, acclaim. I just wish one day popular fiction wasn't a synonym for retard fiction.
0/10"
TWILIGHT,"the book was better and thats not saying much Now do not be offended by any of this, this is just my opinion.
No I am not a rabid Twilight hater. I read the books, yes all of them. I thought they were interesting. Not very original, well thought out, or well written, but decent enough to read. I had several problems with this movie. It's not just the cast. Though I think Cam Gigandet did an excellent job as James. Okay my main problem with the cast was not really who they picked. I guess it boils down to the fact that Bella and Edward really are not that interesting. Is it so much to ask for a heroine who isn't so whiney and can take care of herself. Or maybe a vampire who isn't broody and boring and doesn't SPRAKLE! ((sorry that just bugs the **** out of me)) I think if they had stuck more to the actually book it would have been better. Granted, not by much, but it would have at least gotten 5 stars from me.
I do like the cinematography. The movie is gorgeous visually, and as i stated before the acting was not terrible. I would have picked different people for most of the cast, but thats me. I do have one more thing to say before i end this.
RABID TWIlIGHT FANS NEED TO CALM DOWN!!! ITS JUST A BOOK AND MOVIE SERIES!! don't take the fact that people don't like it to heart. if you like it, thats great."
KNIVES OUT,"Lots of Nice Little Twists No, it wasn't perfect. No it was not Academy Award material. But it was a delightful story with lots of classic whodunnit elements. I thought we got to know each character well and, like in an Agatha Christie novel, fulfilled their roles. I thought Craig did a nice job and kept things moving along. Plummer was good in his limited screen time. Once again, I'm so fed up with people who decide that IMDB presents an opportunity to destroy a valid system by giving a movie such as this a rating of One. Do you really think this film ranks down there with Alligator Women on Venus. That's what the One ratings are for. It's usually because a film gets a little hype and those with no imagination or who are unhappy with their lives feel the need to throw everything off. Use lower ratings, but try to show some objectivity."
KNIVES OUT,Knives out
KNIVES OUT,"Bringing back the classic whoddunit in amazingly entertaining fashion - 8/10 ⭐ What an excellent film by Rian Johnson; definitely feels like the film he was destined to make. Writing that is slick as hell, sublime performances (most notably Daniel Craig who brings his A-game in a wonderfully charismatic turn), superb editing and wonderfully atmospheric music - all tied together by masterful direction. Will probably be among the most fun you have at a theatre this year and fans of Agatha Christie and old murder mystery stories will have plenty to love here - a nostalgically entertaining time!"
KNIVES OUT,"Pimp My Agatha Christie! With the exception of my wife and daughter, and possibly my mother, Agatha Christie is the woman whom I love most on this planet. She truly was the most gifted and brilliant fiction writer who ever lived, and it rejoices me to see that her work still inspires other writers and filmmakers nowadays; more than forty years after she passed away. There are still many adaptations of her original work, but with ""Knives Out"", writer/director Rian Johnson attempts something entirely different. It's abundantly clear that Johnson was inspired by all of Christie's typical trademarks and hobby-horses, and he pays tribute to her most legendary characters and favorite settings, but the plot of ""Knives Out"" is entirely new and scripted directly for the screen. A good old-fashioned murder mystery/whodunit set in the enormous mansion of a wealthy family, full of eccentric people each of whom have dirty little secrets, convoluted plot twists, continuous red herrings that practically make it impossible to guess along, and a fabulous all-knowing but slightly odd sleuth slowly unravelling the clues.
Daniel Craig is downright terrific as Benoit Blanc, a private detective with a bizarre accent and weird one-liners, hired by someone anonymous to dig deeper into the strange and sudden death of patriarch Harlan Thrombey. It looks like suicide, but literally every greedy member of Harlan's bloodline had a motive for killing and - also in delightful Agatha Christie tradition - the plot even thickens after the reading of the will. It would be a shame to reveal too much about the plot, but rest assured that is refreshing and inventive, compelling as well as humorous, complex but simultaneously light-headed and 200% entertaining. The cast is phenomenal. Craig clearly enjoyed depicting a heroic protagonist that is the complete opposite of his James Bond character, and the Thrombey family exclusively exists of great talents, including Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Toni Colette, Christopher Plummer and Don Johnson. ""Knives Out"" is perhaps slightly too long, but never tedious, and very well-directed by Rian Johnson (who honestly doesn't deserve all this hatred from disappointed ""Star Wars"" geeks)"
KNIVES OUT,"Well worth tucking into It was very hard to say no to watching 'Knives Out' and it was one of my most anticipated films since it came out. It was due to being busy and personal problems that stopped me from seeing it sooner. A lot drew me in to watching it. Absolutely love murder mysteries and seeing a lot of comparisons to one of my favourite authors Agatha Christie and the starry cast were reasons enough for me to see it, as well as the great reviews.
Found myself really enjoying, if not quite loving, 'Knives Out'. Can understand why it may not be for all, if one doesn't like seeing and hearing the truth much earlier on than they would expect, and it is easy to see the ridiculing for Daniel Craig's Southern accent (which is admittedly atrocious). Can totally understand its appeal and why it was so positively received though, because to me it was a well made, well acted and cleverly written film that shows that director Rian Johnson does have a great film in him. While not perfect or one of the best films ever made (though was not expecting 'The Godfather' or 'Casablanca' etc), it is a long way from being a 1/10 film, putting it down there with most of the films riffed on MST3K, films from SyFy and the Asylum, 'Home Alone 4', 'NeverEnding Story 3', 'Titanic: The Animated Movie' and the Baby Geniuses films is insulting. As far as 2019 goes, it is towards being one of the better films of that year if not one of the very best.
'Knives Out' had potential to be even better than it was. If it didn't overdo or repeat too much the vomiting running gag and slowed the final solution down (a suitably complicated one that is explained a little too fast for my liking) it would have been a better film.
Wouldn't have said no to the truth (well some of it was) being revealed later than it was, though even when it was placed when it was it was still in the final solution not at all what things initially seemed. The film is a little overlong as well.
However, so much works here. 'Knives Out' looks great, full of atmospheric colour, beautiful locations (the interiors of the house are especially atmospheric), stylishly photographed and slickly edited. Nathan Johnson's score has menace and energy, without feeling overused or over-scored. Johnson directs expertly with a clear love for the genre being sent up.
It is a cleverly scripted film too, shining especially in the smart and affectionate 70s murder mystery throwbacks and deliciously salty one liners and insults from Ransom. The story never felt dull to me and even when things seemed obvious too early some ingenious unexpected twists are brought in. Can totally see how Johnson was so influenced by Christie's writing, evidenced from as early on as the terrific opening sequence and with Christopher Plummer's patriarch character (a type of character seen frequently in Christie's books). A fine example of how to bring freshness to a very familiar genre often visited, while the final solution is incredibly clever though demands full attention.
Moreover, the ensemble cast, one of the best from that year, clearly have a ball. There is some delicious deadpan but also some inspired but not overdone scenery-chewing. Accent aside, Craig does a great job breaking away from his Bond image and revels being comedic in a laconic way. Plummer (RIP) is perfectly cast and while his screen time is not large he makes the absolute most of it. Ana De Armas has one of the most difficult roles and shows no signs of being taxed. Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette, Don Johnson and Michael Shannon all give it everything they've got. My favourite performance came from Evans, also breaking away from typecasting, he was never this witty or salty.
Overall, very, very good. 8/10"
KNIVES OUT,"How can this film currently have a 6.8 rating when it's one of the best pictures of the year?! Sometimes I am shocked when I see a great film...only to see it has an incredibly low overall score on IMDB. This is definitely the case with ""Knives Out""....a great film by writer/director Rian Johnson that I strongly recommend you see. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if this one receives some Oscar nominations...it's that good.
""Knives Out"" is like an Agatha Christie novel set in modern day America and with American characters. But it's not just a homage to Christie-style films but a genuinely good and unique film in its own right. Kudos to many of the actors...particularly Daniel Craig. I thought Craig was miscast as a Southern American detective....but he carried it off wonderfully.
Overall, I have no complaints...nothing I disliked or would do differently. In fact, it was so good I nearly gave it a 10....and I completely enjoyed the movie."
KNIVES OUT,"Bravo! Nothing was typical about this. Everything was beautifully done in this movie, the story, the flow, the scenario, everything. I highly recommend it for mystery lovers, for anyone who wants to watch a good movie!"
KNIVES OUT,"What a ridiculous flick The last few years have had some stinker wannabe ""mystery"" films, especially the recent rehashes of the Hercule Poirot detective tales Murder On the Orient Express and Death On the Nile. The forer was ok, but the latter sucked so hard it was pathetic.
And then theres Knives Out...oof. This was one of the most convoluted movies i have seen in the last decade. It was almost as if the writer had watched too many films by Wes Anderson while on hard drugs and thought he could up the nuanced plot and tone down the comedy. Well great job, you succeeded in making a watered down Wes Anderson story that was barely a passable modern take on Clue. Which was alluded to if not mentioend early in the movie in passing reference.
Watch with a stiff drink or not at all. Because its even worse when a British actor tries to do an American accent, and boy...did they choose terribly with the pained old face of Daniel Craig sounding like a cross between Fog Horn LEghorn and Colonel Sanders. Not as bad as hearing TOm Hardy whisper his bad American accent in the Venom films, but close. If not for the huge cast of well known actors, this would get a lower rating. BUt as it stands, it warrants only a 5 out of 10."
KNIVES OUT,"Refreshing revisit of the classic ""Whodunnit"" Great movie that really does have all the hallmarks of the classic murder mystery. The story is fairly typical, there is a shocking death, everyone has their motives, and piece by piece the truth is pulled together by a sleuth, in this case Benoit Blanc (great name), who comes across as a more modern version of Hercule Poirot.
To discuss the story, is to give away the twists and turns it takes, which are delightful. Tension is maintained really well throughout the film as you constantly try to guess and workout where this mystery is going, and even right at the end the twist that comes doesn't do anything to release that tension until literally the last 1min of the movie.
The real joy though is in an all star A-list cast all performing at the top of their game, and working so well together. In many cases playing against type which is a joy to watch. If you're a fan of murder mystery, then this is a much watch!"
KNIVES OUT,"Not so cleverly constructed Knives Out' is a (barely) contemporary twist on the Agatha Christie template: a country house, a rich dead man, all the family are suspects, and a famous detective is fortunately on hand to sort things out. It's always hokum, but it can be fun when done well. But I didn't find this film a success. The detective had no good reason to be present, for a start (and I didn't find Daniel Craig convincing as an American southerner either). More than that, we learn that the first explanation (the one that only exists to be proven wrong) is false at the moment it is offered to us, meaning that the grand reveal of the full truth upturns nothing of consequence. And the central plot device - a woman who can't lie without vomiting - is not only bizarre, it also means the hero and the audience alike get a pretty preposterous head start on what's really going on. It's entertaining enough; but insufficiently clever as to transcend its inherent ridiculousness."
KNIVES OUT,"Rather Dull Enjoyable in patches, it just doesn't engage. Hollywood has a long history of silly accents, and the accent adopted by Daniel Craig is just plain daft and simply not needed. Why oh why do actors agree to do such things. The biggest irony for me is there is a clip of an episode of 'murder she wrote' and every episode of that Angela Lansbury series was better written and acted than this film. The director can't make his mind up whether this is comedy, pastiche or a real murder mystery. Some of the acting is appalling and none of it that good. The script is badly written and the continuity dodgy in places. There have been other films that have tried such plots with dysfunctional families and none seem to work but such stories seem to on the small screen."
KNIVES OUT,The perfect whodunnit film Beautifully filmed and thought out very well which to me is good enough! Great ensemble cast that did excellent acting among adding hilarious parts in many scenes. Absolutely love Daniel Craig and Ana De Amas did awesome! I'm sure Knives Out has mixed opinions but I am very glad I got to see an early screening.
KNIVES OUT,"Not what I expected and what I saw didn't make me appreciate it any more... Having quality actors and good critical reception, I thought this movie will be fun, so I watched it with my mom, as we love those ""Clue/Cluedo"" style comedy movies. I expected a comedy about weird characters in a mansion trying to solve a murder. Sadly, movie takes a different turn, innovates and changes the old formula of movie like this. This is sad not because of the sole fact that the formula is changed, but because the movie felt really long and boring. It's ending is fun, but... Yeah... This is actually just a classic crime movie, with a few humorous moments. And nothing else. Having in mind the great cast, I expected so much more from this movie and can't help but to fell really disappointed. It could have been so much more! Eh... It's not a bad movie.... It's an OK movie... But not a great one for sure. 6.5/10! It can still be fun and give you a few laughs, but don't expect too much, because you simply won't find it here..."
KNIVES OUT,Kind of overrated to me
KNIVES OUT,"Entertaining, fun, and a better crime solving movie. Knives Out (4.5 out of 5 stars).
Knives Out is a mystery murder crime film which you will have a lot of fun with this Clue like concept as Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) tries to solve a murder. This kind of film reminds me like Murder at the Orient Express. But a little more fun and entertaining. Rian Johnson direction and his witty script makes this movie worth watching. It is fun, there are surprises, and twist and turns.
The plot follows Harlan (Christopher Plummer) who is a patriarch and owns a lot. After he was mysteriously found dead and presumed it was a suicide. A private investigator Benoit Blanc is hired to solve the mystery. With the family being on the will and are wanting their share of Harlan's property and company. Blanc believes there is a suspect that is at large within the family.
The film's plot is a little slow moving. It is a lot of fun. Blanc interviewing every family member Ranson (Chris Evans) who is the black sheep of the family. Linda (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her husband Richard (Don Johnson). Walt (Michael Shannon). Meg (Katherine Langford). Jacob (Jaeden Martell). Joni (Toni Collette). And their house nanny Marta (Ana de Armas). The cast ensemble was great. The performances are fun and entertaining.
The film is filled with surprises with twist and turns. Definitely best seeing without reading or looking up spoilers about it. I would love to see another movie of this.
Overall, Knives Out is a really good film. If you are into the murder mystery kind of movie. This would be it."
KNIVES OUT,"Overrated I watched this based on its reputation and felt let down.
Just the day before, I watched Adam Sandler's Murder Mystery. It's an inferior film but a better whodunnit than this. And the recent Poirot films are better murder mysteries than Knives Out. In fact, I'm not sure why this is called Knives Out since nobody seems to even try backstab each other.
The acting is great and I like the characters. But most of them do nothing of consequence. The murder is solved early on, apart from a lazy twist in the end that was a bit too obvious. There was no air of suspicion or interesting dead ends. There is no real build-up.
I'm not sure why this movie is so hyped. It was okay but not at the level I've experienced from this genre. It's certainly no reinvention, just a lazy stab."
KNIVES OUT,"Hated Last Jedi. Loved this. As a fan of mysteries (Sherlock Holmes, Poirot, Columbo, Monk, Psych.etc.) I was thrilled to see someone making a classic style whodunnit...and the cast! Figure you can't go wrong. Well I enjoyed it & while the cast all have time to shine it is Daniel Craig with his Southern drawl & especially Ana de Armas that steal the show. For anyone keeping away because they hated The Last Jedi...I agree, it was my least favourite of all the Star Wars films, but this is a well written film that was well acted and I can only hope this will inspire others to reinvigorate the murder mystery genre."
KNIVES OUT,"fun time at the movies I enjoyed this a lot. Clever, interesting and plausible in its logic. I enjoyed the deception put forth by the characters. I can usually tell where something is going and was genuinely surprised by the hole in the hole of the donut.
Some people might hate the politics of it, but I thought it gave a good dig at both sides while still being fairly liberal. FOX watchers will hate it, which I can see as kind of fueling the negative reviews.
What can also fuel the negative reviews. is all the positive hype about it. Too much enthusiasm from the critics can hurt a movie sometimes. Viewers go into the theater expecting too much.
Things never live up to the hype and this one didn't live up to it for me. But I thought it was still pretty solid and entertaining. I'm not sorry I spent some money on this one."
KNIVES OUT,"Lower your expectations & you'll enjoy, raise them too much & you'll be disappointed"
KNIVES OUT,"A 45 minute mystery A 45 minute mystery stretched out for two hours! You can figure out who's innocent within the first 30 minutes! This story is so 'actuel' the political/social overtones are unpalatable to the plot. If the average viewer fails to notice this - then they are in a coma!
Plot - a death has occurred in a 'manifest destiny mansion'. And Daniel Craig as inspector 'Benoit Blanc' is hired to investigate. (Personally I think Craig is being groomed to be the Louisiana version of Hercule Poirot). But that phony southern drippy bougainvillea accent is very nerve wrecking. Please don't!
The mystery is good but the process to solve it is needlessly long."
KNIVES OUT,"It's like, did I miss something I saw the film a few months back and now that I noticed it is available for home watch decided to check the eating again, as at the time it was way too high in my opinion. I thought it would have gone down. It has not. Did I miss something spectacular about this film? Do I not have a sense of humor? I don't get it. It was ok. A bit slow. And absolutely nothing special. I think the ending was revealed too early and the twist was not suprising nor did I care about it. Weird."
KNIVES OUT,"Stylish and Very Stupid The movie plays like the worst episode of COLUMBO you have ever seen, only this time it features Daniel Craig attempting to imitate Foghorn Leghorn. Learn from my mistake and avoid this turkey."
KNIVES OUT,"Massively underwhelming Being a middle aged Englishman I've been brought up on a diet of murder mystery stories and in many respects I've been spoilt. When the stories have translated from book to screen the production value is almost always secondary to the good conjunct story. I was very excited, having read the reviews, that seemingly in the case of 'Knives Out' I would be getting a rare trinity of a good story, good actors and good production. It certainly has two of the three. Unfortunately this film thinks it's cleverer than it is. It's simply a story of a privileged family and their pettiness with a rather trivial murder mystery chucked in as a contrivance to get them all together. Rian Johnson attempts to display the worst nature of the privileged minority with all the subtlety of a man screaming 'I am woke' at the top of his lungs at anybody who'll listen. Unfortunately subtlety and nuance are what makes for a good mystery story, you need to pay attention so as not to miss anything. With this film you could miss probably the middle third of the film and you'd not be any less aware of what's happening. A bit of a shame really."
KNIVES OUT,"Just saw it and do not understand the hype I'm a mystery lover and have seen and read every Agatha Christie tale. I found this movie very slow for the first half. Second half picked up but again there was no deep mystery of whodunit, nor the charm and period atmosphere of a Poirot episode (which I can watch over and over - thank you David Suchet and the other main actors). The lead actress was very attractive, but the vomiting was definitely disgusting to watch, as well as ridiculously unbelievable (I guess that was the funny part?). Some of the characters had been under the sunlamp too many times or smoked way too often and looked weather-beaten. Did not like the sucking on cigars constantly. The last part was more entertaining and finally there was the rapid-fire conclusion thank the Lord. Agree that Daniel Craig with that southern accent was just super annoying. Great grandmother bored me after first moments of her being silent in an odd hat. Over and over. It moved pretty slowly for me at times. I guess I'm in a minority on this one. I'm not saying it was terrible but it was not a great movie for me."
KNIVES OUT,Knives Out doesn't cut it.
ANT-MAN,"Extremely fun origin story Ant-Man is an extremely fun origin story and a superb addition to the MCU. Paul Rudd is incredibly charming in the lead role with Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas and Michael Peña giving great supporting performances. The CG is great and the action sequences are extremely impressive. The humour works really well and it's consistently funny. Unfortunately, it does suffer from the weak villain problem that some other Marvel movies suffer from."
ANT-MAN,Works a treat as a light-hearted effects blockbuster 
ANT-MAN,"Minor Marvel, but still good Marvel Having enjoyed a vast majority of Marvel's superhero output (more so than most) without worshipping them, 'Ant-Man' is a minor effort from them but there is still a good amount to like about it.
'Ant-Man' manages to be a better film than expected. The character is not exactly a household name and is always tossed aside in favour of other superhero characters like Spiderman that have had longer longevity and perhaps have more compelling origins and stories, hence why they are adapted more. Also wasn't sure what to make of the trailer, which made the film out to be rather bland and too reliant on humour.
Seeing it for myself finally a year on, 'Ant-Man' could have been better. While the humour mostly works wonders, there are a few instances where it's not so funny and not very well placed, like in emotional scenes that are actually quite poignant and then interrupted by a joke that is not only forced and unfunny but also not belonging in the scene. The family scenes are a mixed bag, sometimes they are sweet and touching while at other times they're a little flat and predictable, contributing towards a few rare dull stretches. Corey Stoll also goes through the motions as the rather generic and under-characterised villain.
On the other hand, 'Ant-Man' is a great looking film, it's beautifully shot, very atmospheric, is very slick and the special effects, mostly the rapid size-changing and with the ants, are clever and of the usual high-quality Marvel standards. The music avoids being over-bearing, one-note, too quirky or too bombastic, fitting well tone, mood and pace-wise. Direction is more than competent, keeping the story going at a solid pace and the telling of it interesting enough, though maybe a little more flavour may have been more welcome. While the action is not as much as most Marvel films, it is fun, thrilling, nicely choreographed and tautly shot and edited, especially towards the end. Admittedly there are a couple of cheesy parts towards the end too, but kind of in an endearing rather than jarring way and it doesn't jar with the rest of the film.
There is some very smart and hugely entertaining scripting and dialogue here in 'Ant-Man' too. While it doesn't work completely seamlessly, 'Ant-Man' is one of Marvel's generally consistently funniest films, and the film doesn't take itself too seriously or too much of a joke either, instead not being afraid to embrace the silliness and humour while ensuring still that the subject matter is treated with respect. It is especially good with the title character's deadpan quips and Luis' fast-talking patter. The story is mostly diverting, it's narratively simpler than most Marvel outings and less risks here are taken than most Marvel films but it always makes sense, moments of dullness and jarring are few (while not being completely absent either), it's fun and it doesn't try to do too much or try to insert too many characters while not playing things too safe either.
While not complex as such, the characters are mostly engaging and are not too one-dimensional, only the villain could have had more done with him. Paul Rudd is a strong and hugely entertaining lead, while Michael Peña's hilarious in a role that could have been really annoying. The seasoned support of Michael Douglas adds hugely too, and Evangeline Lilly gives the film some much needed heart. Anthony Mackie is good too.
Overall, minor Marvel but good Marvel. Well-made and a lot of fun, but there is a personal preference to the Marvel films that took bigger risks with more and often richer characters, bigger bolder action and more going on in the story. 'Ant-Man' executes a vast majority of its components really well indeed, just that Marvel has done even better before and since. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
ANT-MAN,"Best introduction to a new character! Excellent story, just the right amount of comedy, perfect casting and performances, and great S/VFX!"
ANT-MAN,"Fun off Marvel film This is one of those MCU movies that are great but aren't that important in the overall plot of the MCU. Paul Rudd is great in this role. His personality really fit the character. The CGI was top notch. They did a great job shrinking things down. I wonder if he'll have a bigger part in the MCU. Anyway, great enjoyable film here. Worth the watch."
ANT-MAN,"2 legs bad; 6 legs better OK, so I will probably target the wrath of a legion of fan-boys but as a PhD Physicist I will categorically state that much of the science in the Marvel universe is total nonsense. For example, it requires a certain suspension of belief that whole cities can be levitated. But it's called ""Science Fiction"" for a reason, right? ""Ant Man"" pushes that suspension of belief to whole new levels. The concept that a miniaturised man, were such a thing even possible, could exert the same moment and force as a full sized person would make Newton spin in his grave.
With these nagging doubts I watched the trailer increasingly comfortable in my view that, (even with a free cinema pass), this was a film I would avoid like the plague. That was until the final scene, featuring Thomas the Tank engine, that was ludicrously and surprisingly comical. Could it be that, like last year's ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", Marvel had pulled its pompous head out of its ass and come up with an 'Avengers-lite' that could entertain a broader audience? I decided to risk it. And I was glad I did.
Paul Rudd (""Friends"", ""Anchorman"") plays ex-con Scott Lang who is recruited by brilliant scientist and would-be superhero Dr Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and his gorgeous daughter Hope (""Lost"" and ""The Hobbit""'s Evangeline Lilly) to steal a jacket. (No, really). The owner of said jacket, albeit a high-tech jacket, is businessman and all-round bad-guy Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), with evil intent. (You can tell he's evil by what he does to a cute little lamb - this is the worst viewing for sheep since ""Far from the Madding Crowd"".) By miniaturising Lang and securing the help of an army of ants, the stage is set for a heist of a most unusual kind.
This sounds ridiculous to even write. So why does it work? First up, the script by Edgar Wright ( of ""3 Flavours Cornetto"" fame), Adam McKay (""The Other Guys""), Joe Cornish and Paul Rudd himself is as tight as a drum, with some situations and lines that are downright hilarious. A couple of brilliant lip sync scenes, one featuring the requisite Stan Lee cameo, are grin-inducing pleasures.
Supporting the screenplay, the three leading players pull off their roles with enormous panache. Rudd is hugely likable, with all of the smart-whip humour of Downey Jnr.'s ""Iron Man"" but with none of the appalling arrogance. Michael Douglas, in his one outing this year, seems to be revelling in his role and (presumably with the help of some clever makeup and/or CGI) looking very dapper in the 1987 version of his character. And Evangeline Lilly enters the Avenger's world with a bang and looks very comfortable there. In an effective supporting role, Michael Peña (""American Hustle"") adds a comic lightness of touch as fellow robber Luis. Abby Ryder Fortson also deserves special mention (and an Oscar for cuteness) as Lang's young daughter.
Whilst real fan-boys might object to the flippant nature of the film, there are a number of clever cross-overs into the 'mainstream' ""Avengers"" films, with one B-list Avenger guest star and (eventually) an A-list appearance. And (as is common in these films, and notable as 80% of the audience stayed in their seats for the full credits) there is both a mid-credits scene (that's a set-up for the sequel) and a final post-credit scene that (so I'd told) is hugely significant for next year's ""Captain America: Civil War"" (in which Rudd is set to reprise his ""Ant Man"" role).
The director is Peyton Reed, whose limited movie portfolio to date includes Jim Carrey's ""Yes Man"" and ""Bring it On"".
As I found myself thoroughly enjoying the experience, my rating, against all the odds, is twice what I expected it to be. I can't believe I'm saying this
 but I recommend you go see this for a fun movie summer experience."
ANT-MAN,The world's smallest superhero! 
ANT-MAN,"Second most underrated MCU film. Ant-Man is great Heist film disguised as a superhero film. With great performances all around, I'm surprised it doesn't get the attention it deserves. Definitely a must-see-movie."
ANT-MAN,"This movie gets too much hate for no reason This is the most underrated Marvel movie in my opinion. I heard so much bad about it, but I really enjoyed it! It was funny, full of action & had a wholesome ending."
ANT-MAN,"One of the best superhero movies yet I went into this flick not expecting much. I'm not an Ant Man fan so I was not waiting in anticipation for this as much as I wanted to see Age of Ultron.
The character that Paul Rudd plays in this movie is not the Ant Man I wanted to see, and Micheal Douglas' role as Hank Pym, the original Ant man only made me want to see him dawn the suit even more, cause Micheal Douglas was everything a superhero should be in this movie, Charming, really good dialog, and ready for action.
Overall, Ant Man surprised me. It was one of the more unique superhero movies out. Ant Man did things far beyond just punching and kicking that a lot of superheroes are doing on the big screen and went places no other super hero could go making for an action packed adventure. As cool as Ant Man was when he was regular size beating up the bad guys, was as good as when he was shrunken, riding and controlling ants in a world only he can go to.
The villain Darren Cross was actually pretty good too. Not as good as Loki, but just as psycho.
Once again, not an Ant Man fan but this movie is changing my mind. I'm so impressed with what Paul Rudd did with the character.
Not only that, but it's a great Marvel comic movie, in how it intertwines with the whole Marvel cinematic Universe.
Definitely recommend seeing in 3D cause it's that type of movie that deserves it."
ANT-MAN,"One of my favorite Superhero Flicks By far the most underrated Marvel film ever made, Ant-Man is an incredibly fun little action flick that will make you smile from ear to ear. No drama, no bs, Ant-Man's pure focus is to bring a good time to the audience- and it truly succeeds. Between the fun visual gags, quirky sense of humor, and Rudd's charming antics- there is very little do dislike about this movie. The only flaw I really have with the film is the villain. Corey Stoll certainly tries his best in his role as Darren Cross, but it can often be a little too much at times, and his character itself feels rather thinly written- obviously to only serve the purpose of being the films antagonist. That all being said, the yellowjacket suit in the film is incredibly well done, and obviously the Ant-Man suit is perfect as well. Besides Stoll, I truly did enjoy all the performances at hand. Rudd is the obvious standout, capturing his signature charm into a peculiar hero I don't think I could ever get tired of. We also have the great Michael Douglas in a great supporting role, as well as Evangeline Lilly and Michael Pena as our other standouts. The film is incredibly entertaining from start to finish. It's almost two hours long, but you'll feel like you'll want more once the credits role, and even more after. In the end, Ant-Man is a criminally underrated little superhero flick (no pun intended) and just may be one of the MCU's best.
My Rating: 9.6/10."
ANT-MAN,"A Marvellous Molecular Metamorphosis... There's a particle that can make you miniature, scale you down the size of ants and even more, and Scott Lang, is just the man, who has the chance to be less than, with Dr. Pym and Hope Van Dyne, there to make sure; that the devious and the scheming Darren Cross, doesn't get the chance to beat them, and to boss, by releasing Yellowjacket, to those called Hydra and their racket, causing misery and torment, and great loss.
It's one of those cinematic episodes that gets better with subsequent viewings, a great story and you feel there's genuine chemistry between Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly and Michael Douglas - plenty of humour too, well worth a revisit."
ANT-MAN,"It's f-ant-astic. For a few brief moments, the unstoppable juggernaut that is the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) looked like it was about to grind to a halt with Ant-Man. Unlike most other films under the Marvel Studios umbrella, this production has been haunted by doubt and dissension. Fans were nervous about the narrative decisions to relegate Hank Pym – the original Ant-Man in the comic books – to the sidelines, while killing off his wife Janet Van Dyne (who, as the Wasp, is one of the founding members of the Avengers). Then came that hugely publicised parting of the ways between Marvel and original director Edgar Wright, who oozes so much geek cred that people understandably mourned his departure from the project after years of development. And yet, the final product – Peyton Reed's Ant-Man – is a fun, frothy delight, one that proves once and for all that Marvel knows precisely what it's doing and where it's going with the most crazily interconnected movie-and-television franchise of all time.
After serving his jail sentence, Scott Lang (Rudd) just wants to reunite with his daughter Cassie and get his life back on track. But he soon discovers that people in the outside world – including his ex- wife Maggie (Greer) and her new cop boyfriend Paxton (Cannavale) – aren't particularly kind to former convicts. Beaten down by circumstances, he agrees to pull off one last heist with his eternally optimistic buddy Luis (Pena). It's a crime that places him squarely in the path of Dr. Hank Pym (Douglas), a retired, semi-reclusive scientist who decides to enlist Scott in his life-long mission of preventing the Pym Particle – a technological breakthrough that allows him to become the super- small, super-strong Ant-Man – from falling into the wrong hands.
Truth be told, Ant-Man gets off to a somewhat shaky start. The tale of an honourable rogue who's looking for a shot at redemption is a well-worn storytelling trope, one that the film initially seems to embrace rather too eagerly. As we watch Scott soldier through a host of tiny indignities, the dialogue – still credited to Wright and his co-writer Joe Cornish, with rewrites by Rudd and Adam McKay – is uninspired, and oftentimes uncomfortably on-the-nose. There's no subtlety here, and the sense of fun that accompanies Scott's attempt to hold down a job in Baskin Robbins feels a wee bit forced.
But the film kicks into higher gear, and stays there, once Scott stumbles onto or, more accurately, steals his second chance. His discovery of the Ant-Man suit and all that entails – working with Hank, meeting Hank's aloof but eminently capable daughter Hope (Lilly), training to prevent Hank's former protégé Darren Cross (Stoll) from replicating the Pym Particle for sale to the highest bidder – give the story the shot of adrenaline it needs. In the blink of an eye, this superhero heist flick finds its feet, and transforms into a whirlwind of action, humour and heart. Reed's camera zigs merrily from Luis' unique method of exposition (brilliant) to Scott's attempts to survive Hope's training (bruisingly hilarious), before zagging into the dark, trembling heart of Hank's troubled relationship with his daughter.
Indeed, what makes Ant-Man work so well is its insistence on respecting its characters and taking their concerns and relationships seriously. This provides the film with an emotional anchor amidst all the madcap chaos and gleeful irreverence. Scott's overpowering love for his young daughter runs parallel to Hank's own concern for Hope, and even Paxton – initially caricaturised as the stereotypical brutish new boyfriend – is given layers and depth beyond what might be expected of a film that seems so silly on the surface. This culminates in the film's best action sequence: one that manages to be utterly ridiculous, as the camera cheekily zooms in and out of a conflict that's entirely proportional to the size of its participants; but also deeply heartfelt, when Scott makes a split-second decision between life and probable death.
For anyone concerned about Ant-Man subsisting in its own little bubble within the MCU, rest assured that there's plenty on display here to please even the most die-hard of fans. The film features not only a welcome cameo from a very popular agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., but also ties Scott firmly into MCU continuity with a hugely pleasing direct reference to Avengers: Age Of Ultron. The subsequent semi-aerial battle that takes place between Ant-Man and a certain Avenger proves that this miniscule hero has what it takes to stand proud alongside the world's mightiest champions. (Stay through the credits, by the way, for two incredibly exciting hints at what's to come for the MCU in the future.)
As with all the other films and television shows in Marvel's burgeoning media empire, the cast of Ant-Man is pitch-perfect. Rudd puts his goofy and amiably sexy charisma to excellent use as Scott, allowing us to believe that this one man can be as silly as he is strong, and as serious as he is funny. Lilly gets the big-screen role she richly deserves in Hope, who's acknowledged at every point in the film as being better, stronger, and more capable than the men around her think she is. Douglas plays a far more palatable version of Dr. Pym (who can be tough to swallow in the comics), and does so with his trademark charm and magnetism, while Stoll gives good psychopath as the increasingly unhinged, patently cruel Cross.
Ant-Man may not edge out the other films that make up Phase Two of the MCU in a straw poll – it does, after all, face some pretty serious competition in what has been an unbroken run of truly excellent superhero films. But it's an incredibly solid effort: smart, rich, deep and funny, teeming with ideas, genres and the potential for so much more. Now if that doesn't make for a great superhero movie, what does?"
ANT-MAN,"It's Those Little Things That Count! Once again, there's a guy who needs to take over the world and side with a horrible group. He has money and fame and yet he has to go over to the dark side. In this case, he has taken previous research and molded it to his own devices. Michael Douglas first developed the ability to close up molecules and make things turn smaller with intense strength and capabilities. Then he loses his wife and drops from the scene. His right hand man, an ambitious jerk moves ahead and plots evil use of the findings. Paul Rudd plays a poor guy who is divorced. He was sent to prison for a burglary which had some unfair circumstances that led to unfair results. Pyn, Michael Douglas's character, realizes that he has to stop the next step or these bad guys will take over the world and brutalize it. Rudd becomes Ant-Man, not just because he can become small, but because he learns to run with the ants. Of course, the whole thing is high on the hokeyness meter, but, then, it is comic book stuff. It is fun and exciting and works pretty well. It leads to some pretty sappy results, but this is not Fellini or Bergman. It's a joyful effort, using the Marvel trademark."
ANT-MAN,"Better than I thought it would be Antman. When I first heard about the plans for this movie I laughed to myself and thought, ""How can becoming smaller be cool?"" Sure enough, Marvel has surpassed my expectations and turned something I thought would be lame and uninteresting into something hilarious and actually pretty cool. I'm not going to include any spoilers, but I will say the fighting style of Antman is much better than I thought it would be. I learned a lot about the story as well as the abilities he has.
Antman gets much more interesting when doing combat. The ability to shrink and grow at will is something Marvel has gotten very creative with.
The language in this film is good enough for my young children to watch. There are no F or GD bombs to ruin the mood and the moment with the family. I'd say I'd surely watch it again."
ANT-MAN,"One of my all time favorite MARVEL superheros movies Ant-Man (2015) is my all time favorite MARVEL film it is my fourth favorite MARVEL film the first three are Captain America trilogy that I love to death while this movie stays right behind them. It is a fun and entertaining film and I have really enjoyed it, I don't have any problem with the film and I never really read the comic about Ant-Man, but watching this movie it is really solid super-hero movie. Ant-Man is MILES way better than Deadpool (2016) who get's so much praise for it! It is MILES way better than Man of Steel, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, The Wolverine, X-Men: Days of Future Past, X-Men: Apocalypse and Hulk (2003) those movies really sucked. Ant-Man (2015) is better than those movies that is just my opinion you even have a solid cast. I love that Ant-Man doesn't kill people and when they blow up the building no one is hurt, that makes him a superhero.
I am a big fan of Michael Douglas and he does an excellent job as Hank Pym he was excellent. Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man was incredible. I mostly remember him from Friends when he played Mike, Phoebe's boyfriend and he make the movie with Jennifer Aniston also from Friends) The Object of My Affection (1998) he was terrific in Ant-Man. Evangeline Lilly from Lost and Real Steel is incredible excellent as Hope Pym who is Hank's daughter. Corey Stoll as Darren Cross / Yellowjacket was good at in his acting performance as the villain and last and at least Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Falcon was wonderful to see him in this movie I loved it.
Plot: Armed with a super-suit with the astonishing ability to shrink in scale but increase in strength, cat burglar Scott Lang must embrace his inner hero and help his mentor, Dr. Hank Pym, plan and pull off a heist that will save the world.
I love the film because it has a heart and it has a redemption, everyone deserves a second chance. It also has a strong message bonding estrange father and daughter together. Scott Lang is a former systems engineer at VistaCorp and petty criminal who acquires a suit that allows him to shrink in size but increase in strength. The movie is an origin story of the petty crook Scott Lang who comes into contact with a suit and does his best to make good, and then look at someone like Paul Rudd, who can do slightly unsavory things like break into people's houses and still be charming and who you root for and whose redemption you will find satisfaction in. He becomes Ant-Man and he is doing the right things for his daughter. He's ex wife throws him out while her new boyfriend is a cop pursuing Lang, he has one chance to make this right to be in his daughter's life. REDEMPTION.
I have enjoy the visuals effects and the CGI was pretty good creating Ant-Man I didn't mind it. Checked Ant Man out again very fun entertaining comic book movie that didn't use the alien invasion angle, falling buildings or the world is gonna end, just a simple story, great visual effects and likable characters. The Ant-Man/Falcon fight was bad ass and I loved how Ant-Man defeated him. He saved his daughter Cassie and he showed that he is a good father. In the comics he used pills instead of discs to enlarge and shrink things. I think that was a good change they made.
A final battle scene in the daughters bedroom on her Thomas Tank engine train track, imaginative an original and fun. Marvel's latest may not be their greatest achievement but yet another gamble for a character that is less then popular in that Universe. Adding the legendary Michael Douglas to the cast was pure genius much as Robert Redford played along in The Winter Soldier. The overall movie is fun and the execution of performances are fine but Ant-Man doesn't quite have the punch that I was expecting nor rank in the top five of all the Marvel films thus far. However the character should have a few solo efforts in the pipeline not to mention he's be seen in Civil War and most likely the next two Avenger Infinity War movies.
The rating I give to this film is 10/10 it is my favorite MARVEL film I own it on Blu-ray disc and I enjoy it watching it, it is a pretty damn solid good movie at least for me.

ANT-MAN,"Good Laughs and Plenty of New Action In my opinion, this is Marvel's first stab at something close to the comedy genre, and it does a good job with it. It's funny all the way through, it has some pretty horrifying scenes, and it includes a new set of characters fans can immediately fall in love with. There's nothing quite like a criminal becoming one of the most famous superheroes. Paul Rudd outdid himself introducing us to Ant-Man, and I'm really pleased with Marvel's choice to cast him. Michael Douglas plays a very good sarcastic, angry Hank Pym. There are a couple scenes that are a little mediocre, but they're not bad even then. The movie's paced well and has a sleuth of great moments, making it one of my favorite Marvel movies."
ANT-MAN,"Mammoth in its Tiniest Form Had it been too desperate and hopeless, ANT-MAN would have shrunk its way for admission to the almost-complete, Avengers team. But neither such concern nor saving the world from an impending catastrophic destruction, holds weight heavy enough to pull this miniature superhero from his top priority: winning back his daughter. The emotional weight of the narrative comes across as an anomalous content to the generally comedic structure of the film, but they serve purpose for the overall flow of the proceedings, nonetheless.
The film follows Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), who has just been released from prison after committing burglary. He has been prohibited to see his daughter due to his inability to provide financial support, no thanks to his being an ex-con that keeps hindering him from getting a job. He meets the highly-intellectual yet solitary scientist, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), who has a job for him: pulling off a heist on his ex-protégé, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), who is in possession of a size-changing prototype, that poses massive amount of threats to worldwide security. Using a military suit that allows him to shrink back and forth, in size, Lang carries on with the mission with the hope that by doing so, he would be able to reclaim and earn the reputation and respect he lost, especially his daughter's.
It's easier to see Ant-Man as a beautiful mess, rather than a well-crafted superhero flick with profound depth and sense . There's a lot of illogical nonsense that always nearly sends the film to wreckage, but there's also so much of the fun side to make up for the eventual narrative shortcoming. At the center of its comic efforts, Paul Rudd's Scott Lang/Ant-Man shines with his general amiability, pulling off his role with credible wit and comic allure. Rudd is such a delight here, and his presence and effortless take on his character make the mostly messed-up flow of the events, extremely palatable. There's also much to say about Michael Douglas, how his character, Pym, easily integrates well with Lang and his daughter, Hope (Evangeline Lily) , to provide a firm and well-knitted character framework. Corey Stoll, on the other hand, is less impressive, barely providing the needed threat to make his presence felt and his belligerence imminent. But on moments where he and Lang engage in beautifully-choreographed fight scenes, the ineptitude gets relegated below the more important aspects of the proceedings, and once it does, the breathtaking visual schemes work under the spotlight, capturing Lang's size-changing skill with epic elaborateness. There's magic in every size shift, and the visual artistry is at its peak to deliver the moment.
Perhaps, one of the most immediately-noticeable difference of Ant-Man from its Marvel fellows is that it doesn't engage, nor rush too much, to explosive battles that generally results to immeasurable destruction. It is noticeably evident on the fact that its most interesting and most jaw-dropping action setpiece, happens in a toy train set. Most importantly, this new addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe places its comic prowess at the center of its general effort to validate its entry to the franchise, and that is achieved without putting the natural action/adventure tendency of its superhero, nor the inevitable emotional nature of its characters, at risk of getting overshadowed by the rudimentary elements of the narrative.
It's actually hard to gauge ANT-MAN using the same measure that made the rest of its pack, mammoth and omnipotently powerful. But in its own right, and sub-atomic scale, this microscopic superhero is clearly a power behemoth, and it will surely spring back to its even bigger form, once the Avenger call is delivered."
ANT-MAN,"A delightfully entertaining Marvel superhero movie that you'll enjoy from beginning to end, thanks to leading man Paul Rudd's slacker dude charm This reviewer wants to be like Paul Rudd when he turns 46. He first saw the New Jerseyborn actor on the popular sitcom Friends as Phoebe's love interest Mike Hannigan, and loved how he carried off the character with a slacker charm. He then went on to takes on roles in Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004), The 40 Year Old Virgin (2005) and Knocked Up (2007). Although he played supporting characters in this comedies, there's always that special something which made viewers pay attention.
And now, Rudd is Ant-Man! Yes, a Marvel superhero! If you are like this reader, who isn't a walking encyclopaedia of Marvel history, you probably haven't heard of Ant-Man. Who can take a superhero with a name like that seriously? Not us. Are you sure you need Ant-Man when you've already got Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Captain America, Black Widow and Hawkeye from The Avengers?
One thing we are setting straight here – we enjoyed Ant-Man more than the recent The Avengers: Age of Ultron.
The Peyton Reed directed movie, which is also the 12th installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (who's keeping count, really?), sees protagonist Scott Lang (Rudd) help Dr Hank Pym (the always reliable Michael Douglas) safeguard the mystery of a technology which allows users to decrease in size but increase in strength. In the movie, you will hear some scientifically complicated terms, but there isn't really much to know. You just need to be aware of the fact that there is a need to stop a heist that will destroy Earth,
The threat comes in the form of Yellojacket, a thwarted version of the technology helmed by Darren Cross, and coming along for the ride is Dr Pym's daughter Hope van Dyne, and a motley crew of former thieves who will aid Lang save the world.
The 117 minute movie is a very refreshing change from the slew of superhero movies we've been seeing. No overwrought emotions, no excessive self righteousness and no overbearingly dark tones. What you get instead, is a very likable protagonist (thanks to Rudd's appeal, of course) who is an everyman you want to root for. The result is a superhero movie that makes you sit up and watch, laugh and enjoy till the very last minute.
Because it is backed up by a major studio, you can still expect the usual special effects, big explosions and well choreographed action sequences. These are enough to keep fans of Hollywoodblockbusters happy, and to have them feeling that the movie is well worth the price of the ticket.
Credit goes to a wonderful ensemble cast, which includes Evangeline Lilly (The Hobbit series, TV's Lost) as the serious but well intending daughter, Corey Stoll (Dark Places, TV's House of Cards) as the villainous disciple and Bobby Cannavale (Blue Jasmine, Chef) as a stepfather to Lang's daughter, as well as Michael Pena (End of Watch, American Hustle), rapper Tip ""T I"" Harris and David Dastmalchian (The Glass Menagerie, Buried Child) as Lang's amusing but resourceful friends.
In this day and age where everyone takes everything too seriously, this is one superhero movie that you'll fine immensely entertaining and enjoyable, without compromising on storytelling and action. Oh, you should also stick around to watch not one, but two end credit scenes which will eventually take the Internet by storm."
ANT-MAN,"Bursting with Personality Ant-Man has been through a very long development, it was started with Edgar Wright committing to write and direct the film, but years went by and Marvel finally has a studio of its own, manipulations do compromise Wright's vision which lead him leaving the project. In spite of that issue, the film spares much of his screenplay as it still has his trademarks all over the place. While it's delightful to notice those sequences being left intact, there is still a dejected feeling of what it could have been if he actually handled it entirely. For now, most of the style is basic Marvel. As a movie itself, it's quite refreshing to see a superhero film that doesn't contain much heavy handed explosions compared to the last few films they gave us. And it's a good reminder that joy can still be found in this genre even at its smaller scale, thanks to its engaging cast and downright appealing personality.
The movie doesn't involve stopping some mass destruction or a general build up for future installments (the reference still exists, but isn't exactly the priority.) People may brag about this as going back to the basic mold of origin stories where you see outcasts living in a city having unexpected fate of becoming a superhero. The difference however is the premise is a lot sillier that is taken with vast self-awareness through that concept. The entirety is basically a mix between family drama and smart comedy. The comedic side is where it thoroughly shines, the film finding energy through its visuals and each actor's charisma. The drama on the other hand is basically to establish the character's pathos through their backstories. It's not quite subtle, but fits enough to breathe after a set of sillier spectacles.
The major plot is basically just a heist, except the main character has the ability to alter his own scale while spectators and their enemies are constantly being flummoxed about what exactly is happening. It's simple, but there is so much going on and yet it is made easily exciting by its own personality and crazier imaginations, you can identify that most of the creativity came from Wright's idea. How the movie recreates his style from the script is fine and it's admirable to retain the same quirk and energy from the vision at some points. At the other scenes, it's typical Marvel flare, and as said, it looks cool, but it's more remarkable at the less conventional turns.
Paul Rudd brings real charisma and some depth to Scott Lang, keeping him from being a generic anti-hero. Michael Douglas establishes actual depth within Hank Pym in a lot of moments. Corey Stoll embraces his almost unbelievably inhumane role, which strangely makes it an effectively menacing villain. Evangeline Lilly appears to be more than a love interest and that is alright. Michael Peña steals all of his scenes, which a role that could have been just another comic-relief, he makes all of his character's greatest comedic moments remarkably delightful.
It's still quite inevitable to keep bringing up the supposed-to-be helmer of Ant-Man, because his fingerprints are really there, while it's actually nice to see it hinting every once in a while, it also feels somewhat exasperating for what daring opportunity it could have been. We'll never know the answer. Still, Ant-Man brings a sheer amount of fun. It's filled with comicbook enthusiasm and memorable laughs that appropriately sticks through its actually preposterous property. The cast helps bringing all of it to life, from levity to gravity. The action is executed with affecting weirdness. Ant-Man is best when it's weirder, because that is where it speaks its own flavor."
ANT-MAN,"I was not expecting this... Brilliant addition to the MCU. AntMan is a lesser know character of marvels but by no means does that effect the quality of this movie. First off I thought that the casting of this film wasn't going to work, that been Paul Rudd mainly, just because I have read a few of the AntMan comics and didn't think it was going to work, I was wrong he is brilliant, hilarious and believable, all of the jokes he made actually made laugh out load which doesn't happen much. Michael Pena was great in this film, he plays the same kind of character he always seems too, but it really works, especially the story telling scenes were hilarious. This was a all round well cast film.
The action and CGI Was great, on first thoughts I thought when AntMan shrinks down that the CGI would take you out of the movie but let me tell you it doesn't, it's awesome! Especially seeing the world from that size and scenes where AntMan is shrinking and enlarging when fighting i thought would get a little too much but the honestly don't.
All around I AntMan felt different to all the other MCU movies that have come out, but a good different. A well cast,directed and acted film that will be a welcome addition to my marvel collection."
ANT-MAN,Something's not Wright here 
ANT-MAN,"Size Does Not Matter I was not really aware of a Marvel character named Ant-Man until recently when articles and trailers about this film began coming out. I was not really that excited until I learned that he was actually one of the original Avengers, then that really got my interest piqued to go watch this one and learn about this previously unfamiliar superhero.
Hank Pym was a noted scientist who discovered how to reduce the distance between atoms, enabling objects to be shrunk. Pym suppressed his discovery because of its dangers, which led to the death of his wife. Obsessed, his protégé Darren Cross eventually develops his own shrinking technology but with less than noble purposes in mind.
In order to prevent potential disaster, Pym decided to recruit Scott Lang, an electronics engineer turned petty burglar, to steal Cross' Yellowjacket project. To be able to achieve this mission, Pym, along with his daughter Hope van Dyne, trained Lang to become a micro- superhero who can communicate and command ants to do his bidding -- the Ant-Man.
I did not know anything about the Ant-Man, his origin and abilities going in, but this film made me a new fan of this cool superhero. Director Peyton Reed only had mostly comedies like ""Bring It On"" (2000), ""Down with Love"" (2003) and ""The Break-Up"" (2006) in his resume. But with his first foray into the superhero genre, he totally made ""Ant-Man"" an exciting and riveting film that holds your attention from beginning to end with its excellent action and crackling humor. Reed took over from original director/scriptwriter Edward Wright, who dropped out of the project citing creative differences with Disney.
For me, the casting of 46 year old Paul Rudd in the lead role came totally from left field. Since his breakthrough role as Josh in ""Clueless"" (1995), Rudd was only relegated playing mainly supporting roles in small unmemorable comedies. However, like his ""Parks and Recreation"" co-star Chris Pratt's success as Peter Quill/Star Lord before him, Rudd actually fit right into character as Scott Lang. Rudd had that good-boy charm which was able to make us sympathetic to this small-time crook desperately wanting to do good for the sake of his daughter Cassie (played by Abby Ryder Fortson).
Evangeline Lilly proved that the action skills she showed as the elf Tauriel in the last two Hobbit films were no fluke. Her Hope van Dyne is fierce with attitude, with toned arms and shoulders to boot. I do take exception to her annoying hairstyle that was reminiscent of that worn by Dallas Bryce Howard on ""Jurassic World"". What's up with that ""Dora""-do with the bangs and Hollywood nowadays?
The role of Hank Pym could have been dry and didactic in the hands of another actor, but Michael Douglas really made this character vital and interesting. His sense of humor was on point. His was the character that was connected with everyone else being the original Ant-Man, and he had excellent working chemistry with everyone: Scott, Hope and villain Darren Cross (played by Corey Stoll).
Michael Peña, David Dastmalchian and rapper T.I. played a comical trio of petty crooks with whom Scott hung around. They provide additional humor to the proceedings, especially when things get serious towards the climax. Bobby Cannavale played a clueless cop Paxton who is now the new husband of Scott's ex-wife Maggie (Judy Greer), and step father to Cassie. His character made Scott's life considerably more complicated.
The technical aspects of this film were top rate, particularly the amazing visual effects. I really liked the scenes of Ant-Man interacting with the different types of ants. The fight scene of Ant-Man vs. a special guest Avenger was also very well-executed. Those scenes in little Cassie's room where there was a carpeted play area with a toy Thomas train running on its tracks was way better than how it looked in the trailer. The expert film editing was seamless even as scenes (and the sizes of the characters) were shifting so quickly.
Aside from mentions of Stark, S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers, there were also two scenes in the end credits (one mid-credit, and another one at the very end) which reveal how Ant-Man will fit into the current Marvel Cinematic Universe situation. Unlike the rather disappointing, heavy- handed ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" right before it, ""Ant-Man"" was entertaining beyond my expectations. Marvel does it again! 9/10."
ANT-MAN,"Highly Entertaining Adventure In 1989, the scientist Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) quits working for the S.H.I.E.L.D. when he discovers that they have unsuccessfully tried to replicate his shrinking technology named Ant-Man that he considers too dangerous for mankind. In the present days, Dr. Pym was forced by his daughter Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) and his former protégé Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) to leave his company Pym Technologies to them. Further, he finds that Darren is developing his own shrinking technology named Yellowjacket.
Meanwhile, the small-time burglar Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is released from prison and welcomed by his former cell mate Luis (Michael Peña) that wants him to participate in a heist. However Scott wants to find an honest job to take care of his beloved daughter Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson) that lives with his estranged wife Maggie (Judy Greer) and her future husband Detective Paxton (Bobby Cannavale). However his criminal record does not give a chance to him and he accepts to participate in the heist of the house of a millionaire. He finds only a special suit in the safe and he is arrested again by the police. Soon he learns that he is part of the scheme plotted by Dr. Pym and Hope to make him a superhero wearing the suit and save the world destroying the Yellowjacket. Without any alternative, Scott is trained by Dr. Pym and Hope in the beginning of an incredible adventure.
""Ant-Man"" is a highly entertaining adventure with another Marvel (unknown) hero. The plot is very funny and it is funnier to read reviews showing plot holes based on science and forgetting that the story is based on a comic magazine. The special effects are also great and it is good to see Evangeline Lilly again. There are two scenes entwined in the credits, the last one in the very end. My vote is eight.
Title (Brazil): ""Homem-Formiga"" (""Ant-Man"")"
ANT-MAN,"An All Around Very Good Movie Ant-Man (2015)
*** 1/2 (out of 4)
Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is released from prison and plans on going straight but that doesn't go as planned but he's recruited by Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) to try out a suit that manages to shrink his size while making him even stronger. Soon Ant-Man has to try and stop a bad guy (Corey Stoll) trying to sell the secret.
ANT-MAN is a film that really took me by surprise. I'm not a comic book person so I wasn't familiar with this character or the story. I was really shocked at how entertaining the personal drama was as well as how exciting the action was. When I first saw the trailer I couldn't help but think of HONEY, I SHRUNK THE KIDS and this film actually benefits from the same thing that movie did and that's the rather cool effect of being small and surrounded by large, everyday items.
This is certainly one aspect that makes the film so entertaining because the entire idea of someone being able to shrink and then go back to their regular size in the matter of seconds is just fun. Even more fun is the way he is trained into becoming this warrior because it not only adds some great action scenes but also some very good laughs. You've got the action and the laughs but I thought the film also sold the personal drama that the main characters have.
A lot of credit has to go to the cast for pulling this off. Rudd is as perfect as Ant-Man as Robert Downey, Jr. is as Iron Man. The casting was simply perfect because Rudd can perfectly handle the drama, the comedy and the action and he makes for a complete character. Douglas also adds a lot to the film in his supporting role as does Stoll as the villain. Michael Pena and Bobby Cannnavale are both good in their supporting bits as is Evangeline Lilly in her role.
ANT-MAN also benefits from clocking in under two hours as the film never seems too long. The story isn't dragged on and instead we're given non-stop action and fun. There have been many good movies made from Marvel comics but ANT-MAN is certainly among the best."
BABYLON,"Excess is the name of the game Whether it be orgies, showcasing various bodily fluids, plot threads, or the runtime of the film, Damien Chazelle is fully unrestrained in his latest film. La La Land and Whiplash are some of my favorite films and I'm a big fan of Chazelle's directorial style. He shows flashes of that brilliance often throughout Babylon, but does indulge in his most extreme tendencies as well in this modern Hollywood epic.
There is a lot I liked here. The opening sequence is a sight to behold and had me mesmerized with its vibrant energy. The film chugs along at a good pace for the next two hours to the point I really didn't feel the runtime for most of it. It's the last hour or so where Chazelle loses the story a bit. There were several instances where I thought the film was over, but another scene would pop up next. The runtime really feels unnecessary and there's honestly whole plot lines that could be cut out that wouldn't affect the film.
Justin Hurwitz has composed another terrific score (with some nice hints of La La Land) and the photography, costumes, and production design are all stellar. Outside of some shoddy editing, especially a bizarre movie montage at the end that really did not gel, the technical aspects of the film are quite an achievement.
Chazelle really needed someone to tell him no with this film. Some better editing combined with some self-restraint and this would be much closer to the epic masterpiece status he's clearly aiming for. As it stands, it's a pretty entertaining tale of excess and fame in early years of Hollywood."
BABYLON,"At least an hour too long. This film felt like it was written and directed by a high school drama class kid with ADHD. It was exhausting to watch, and it was all over the place with too much filler, too many unnecessary sub-plots, convoluted scenes and dialogue, with horrible editing and scene start and cuts. In the hands of better more experienced filmmaker, this could've very easily been so much better and more enjoyable. Writer and director Damien Chazelle gave us a hack-job screenplay with overzealous and pointlessly outlandish scenes, that are all style with very little substance. The all star stellar cast were all amazing, especially Margot Robbie - who was the only reason I didn't stop watching 40+ mins into this utter disastrous nonsense. The critics got this one right. It's a very generous 6/10 from me, all going to the performances and decent cinematography."
BABYLON,"Babylon is Destined for Polarizing Feedback but It's a Bumping and Crazy Party for Better or Worse After an ""interesting"" opening scene about our main character Manny (Diego Calva) trying to get an elephant up to a party in Bel-Air, Babylon floors the gas pedal and barely comes up for air for the rest of the run time. I wanted to credit Damien Chazelle and his team for providing a unique experience in regards to pacing, setting and tone. The expression ""fever dream"" is overused but Babylon is captured in such a chaotic and constantly shifting way that kept me enraptured. The movie looks fantastic and even if you don't have an interest in this period of cinema, I don't doubt that Babylon will still pull you in. The costuming and sets are dynamic and show how disorganized and tumultuous early Hollywood was. I was hooked from the get-go and for all the movie's flaws, its presentation is vibrant and fast-moving to keep help you entertained.
While Babylon is distinctive with its look and pacing, when it comes to the characters, things are a little more familiar. Conrad and LaRoy are loosely based on a couple of people from that era but the lessons the movie wants to teach us about Hollywood chewing up and spitting out talent are pretty routine. I think Babylon is effective at getting those across but I was a little let down that the movie starts so bombastically and then quietly tip toes into conventionality by the end. Some characters are meant to be less distinctive (Manny is the audience avatar for example) but while I wish they were a little more fresh, I did want to follow them throughout the length of the movie.
Damien Chazelle has enough of a name now that he could probably get any actor/actress he wanted in his cast. He still attracted some big and interesting names for Babylon. I think every member of the main cast did a fantastic job and it's a credit to them and Chazelle for getting the most out of his performers. Brad Pitt's the biggest name and I really enjoyed the work he put in as Jack Conrad. He's appropriately funny in Conrad's lush and over-the-top behaviour but he garners some genuine sympathy for him when the world turns against him. Pitt could have played it so big that he came off as an entitled prick but there's some warmth and passion to Conrad and Pitt gets that across. I've always liked Margot Robbie and she's on point here as Nellie. She throws herself into it completely, there's a surprising amount of physicality and nuance in Nellie's whirlwind behaviour. Much like Pitt, she's really funny when she is given the opportunity to be. Despite the pretty telegraphed arc for her character, you understand why Manny can't resist Nellie even when it's crystal clear she's bad news wrapped in pretty packaging. I would hope that Pitt and Robbie both get awards consideration for their work here. Diego represents the audience, he's witnessing all the craziness and has to go along with it. He's a pretty blank slate but there's enough from Diego that his character is distinct and you understand his motivations. I want to credit Li Jun Li and Jovan Adepo as Lady Fay Zhu and Sidney Palmer respectively. Their characters are written with a heavy hand but both are sympathetic and have their respective moments. The oddest casting is Tobey Maguire as threatening mobster James McKay but Maguire's surprisingly good at being a creepy underworld figure.
Getting to the negatives, Babylon is a movie that indulges in the exact same vices that it's lambasting. As a film, Babylon's determined to show all excess and hedonism of the era in all its ""glory."" I appreciated some of this but there are moments where the movie gets pretty gross (there's an early scene involving a elephant that is going to shock people) and while I get what Chazelle and his team are trying to show, was it really necessary? I'd argue not. Babylon's lengthy run time is also going to drive some people away but it also has an affect on how the story twists and turns. Characters that started out with more depth gradually turn more generic (Nellie specifically comes to mind) and you could have easily trimmed some of the fat off this movie. The total length of Babylon feels a little self-indulgent and while the previously mentioned frenetic pace keeps you guessing, it saps some of the ending's impact. I got what the movie was trying to say with its wrap-up but I can't deny I was bouncing in my seat in anticipation of getting to leave.
Just like the lavish and insane partying that Babylon presents, you have to choose to take the hit of whatever your poison of choice is and dive in headfirst or not to indulge and slip out the back. Babylon is going to be an incredibly polarizing film and while I enjoyed large parts of this movie, there were also many scenes that fell flat for me. I'd grade Babylon somewhere between a 7 and an 8 but I'm rounding up because there are moments where Babylon has some real cinematic magic. I'm not comfortable wholesale recommending Babylon, if you're interested in a Wolf of Wall Street style comedy about the excess of Hollywood in the 1920s that gets pretty dark, check it out."
BABYLON,"Overindulgence doesn't make a good movie So many reviews praise this film for the level of ""debauchery"" shown in it or the devotion the actors gave to said debauchery. But just because you have the willingness to fill your film with an over excess of sex, drugs, violence, and human bodily fluids doesn't mean you have a good film. This movie feels like it goes on forever and has endless character who serve no real purpose to progressing the story. At the core there is a decent plot but it falls apart and some of the scenes feel like they were written by a teenage boy imagining what his ideal ""fantasy"" would play out like. This movie will easily become a cult classic just for how vulgar it is."
BABYLON,I'm with the elephant! 
BABYLON,Ambitious film torpedoed by weak and self-indulgent script 
BABYLON,"GAVE UP! I gave up after the first hour. I have been a follower of movies from the 20's 30's and 40's and amateur film historian for over 45 years. This is supposed to be a tribute somehow? At least try to capture the spirit and style of the 20''s please. Music, dancing, clothing, mannerisms, speech- no effort made to recreate the actual era. Mini-Halter dresses worn with high heeled boots, table dancing like modern strippers flashing modern day panties. People shaking like they're at a Sex Pistols concert instead of actual dances that were popular like the Charleston. Yes, the 20's in Hollywood were a lot more decadent than anyone let on at the time but this is ridiculous . Characters supposedly based on John Gilbert, Anna May Wong, Clara Bow, a few references to other actual real life people and incidents, but to anyone that is a true fan of early Hollywood mostly a degrading, insulting, historically inaccurate. Also extremely boring."
BABYLON,"Over-indulgent, bloated and, ultimately, pointless! My main takeaway when I left the theater this evening after watching this film, was that it was far too long and had probably one storyline too many to make this movie fly, but instead after the first act, it drags, and drags, and drags.
The funny thing is, the best moments of this film are within the first hour. The less cohesive and more chaotic the film was, the more exciting it felt. After that point though, the film falls apart, the plotlines stray and the film has maybe 50% of the crazy energy that the first third had. It attempts to try and regain that energy in the finale, but doesn't quite capture what came before it. It turns from debauchery to horror, and it didn't gel well for me. Felt like the tone contradicted itself from where it began.
The acting on the other hand is fantastic. Robbie and Pitt are electric, and the way Diego Calva can emote without saying anything is brilliant. I just wished the script and direction from La La Land writer/director Damien Chazelle was as good as the acting. Sometimes, the film felt like I was watching four films at the same time. Each of these plotlines could have had their own movies and seeing them all jumbled together here felt self indulgent and exhausting by the end of it. Only one of the storylines have any sort of ending that makes it feel justified in it's telling. Afterward, when the credits start to roll, you're just sat there with no feeling for what you just witnessed for a little over three hours.
Overall, I only recommend for people who don't mind the three hour runtime, but keep in mind that the films plot goes absolutely nowhere, and although it might be a fun trip at times, it is a rather pointless one.
2 talking pictures out of 5."
BABYLON,Damien's Inferno 
BABYLON,"desperately trying too hard It's 1926 Hollywood. The silent movie era is having a party of epic debauchery. Manny Torres (Diego Calva) is the 'Mexican' fixer servant doing all the dirty jobs. Jack Conrad (Brad Pitt) is the big movie star. Nellie LaRoy (Margot Robbie) is the flamboyant nobody who fakes it until she makes it. She makes it and then the silent era ends. Everybody works to master the new sound era.
This is not an appealing start. I don't know what's happening with every Oscar bait movie which insists on an overly broad comedic scene with bodily functions. The elephant is completely overboard. I wouldn't open with that scene. It's an indication of what's to come. This movie is desperately trying too hard.
I guess we're supposed to root for Margot Robbie, but I don't. I find her abrasive and not always appealing. She does find her tragic heartbreaks and that helps her character. This would work better if it concentrated more on Brad Pitt's character. He has some of best heart-felt scenes during his climax. Manny Torres is probably the other main character with a big character arc. I like the character, but the performance is too stoic. I need a different performance from him.
Besides Brad Pitt's character arc, I love the general premise of redoing ""Singin' in the Rain"". It's a great premise that needs a little foreshadowing and less outrageousness. It could be a simple modern day revival with admiring fans watching ""Singin' in the Rain"" to open this movie. Damien Chazelle is just trying too hard. It hits a few false notes and the whole enterprise stumbles. It always gets back up with some very compelling scenes. For example, the first sound shot is fun. I don't like how it ends. Damien keeps pushing the comedy one step too far. I do appreciate the overall premise and the ambition of the work."
BABYLON,"A big, bloated, shapeless mess, filled with lazy caricatures I've seen all four of Damien Chazelle's movies; none has struck me as especially satisfying. This one, all three joyless hours of it, gave me barely a moment of pleasure. It's a perfect example of -- in a phrase often used by Esquire -- ""wretched excess.""
It purports to be, in part, that rather trite creation, ""a love letter to the movies,"" but spends most of its time trashing Hollywood as a pit of debauchery -- a slander that never feels remotely authentic (even though I was raised on Kenneth Anger's ""Hollywood Babylon""). The film titillates us with pulp-magazine fantasies of subterranean caverns outside the city where, by torchlight, jaded Angelenos gaze at torture, rat-swallowing, and other depraved acts. Its cast of characters -- the overprivileged fading film star, the shallow, wildly hedonistic sexpot heroine, the loyal, upright Mexican immigrant, the cynical gossip columnist, the passel of ludicrously snooty L. A. millionaires and their catty wives -- all felt like old cartoons. Even the crowd at the protracted orgy that opens the movie felt choreographed and utterly fake: frenetically cheering, dancing, and gesticulating at times in a caricature of Hieronymus Bosch, the next moment transformed into a sedate, respectful nightclub audience as silent as a library.
I did appreciate the music in this film, as well as the decor, the hundreds of extras, and the constantly moving camera. But ultimately I think Chezelle was provided with way too large a budget and simply squandered it."
BABYLON,"An indulgent mess with surprisingly little to say Given that ""Whiplash"" and ""La La Land"" were outstanding films, it seemed reasonable to hope-and expect-that director Damien Chazelle's new film would deliver. It seemed to be a unique spectacle of excess and debauchery in 1920s Hollywood that would combine flashiness with, hopefully and given Chazelle's previous track record, a compelling story and profound character development. Tragically, however, ""Babylon"" is a bloated misfire that ends up being unique for all the wrong reasons.
Right off the bat, Chazelle brings the viewer along for a ride that ends up being a fusillade of pulse-pounding jazz music, a whirlwind of hedonism, and increasingly sophomoric and eye-rolling moments. This would have all been fine if he had a more coherent story or contextual justification for his indulgence, but alas, he doesn't. After all, some exceptionally well-directed films such as Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"" (or even ""The Wolf of Wall Street"") or Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Boogie Nights"" completely wrap themselves around a crackerjack, virtuoso sense of intensity while simultaneously complementing their own narratives. Unfortunately, ""Babylon"" does not do the same. The debauchery starts to get increasingly tiring after a while when the characters doing it are thinly written (especially by Chazelle standards) and uninteresting, in contrast to better films about excess that keep the viewer wholly engaged over a long runtime. The film's plot is pretty loose and unengaging for a gargantuan 189-minute runtime, which does not help matters much either. The performances are fine but unexceptional, yet even the more talented actors in the cast can't elevate the disappointing and sometimes-pointless screenwriting they've been given to work with. The result is a movie that feels far less satisfying and impactful than it should have, especially since its many moving parts don't really add up to anything. Even the film's message about the ""magic of cinema"" comes off as a bit hollow given that many far better films have dealt with that topic.
I hope Chazelle's next film will be stronger than this one, and something I will be eagerly awaiting. Given some of his previous works, he is certainly and clearly qualified of making great films. Unfortunately, ""Babylon"" isn't one of them. 4/10."
BABYLON,"Decadent Decay... Far too long, for the reward that it withholds, although it's fearless and adventurous, quite daring and quite bold, overflowing with depravity, full of wicked immorality, indulgence and degeneracy, quite an orgy that unfolds.
The Roaring Twenties, and roaring doesn't quite capture the excesses presented here with a film that paints quite a colourful picture of the world of silent movies and their transition to the planet of sound. Margot Robbie smashes it out of the park, as well as producing voluminous amounts of vomit, however, take away the spectacle, and you're left with an often told tale you've seen many times before, and an eager anticipation to watch Singin' in the Rain for the nth time, a revisit your unlikely to make quite as often with this, as once is more than enough."
BABYLON,"Decadence Babylon is a long, messy, repulsive, and magnetic spectacle. Unfortunately despite the great performances and set pieces it doesn't live up to Chazelle's previous work.
The movie wants to bring you down into the waste yard that is Hollywood then pull you out to see the beauty that grows out of the trash. The problem is the movie spends so much time in the mud, and goes so deep into it that by the time it tries to pull you out at the end it's too late.
On the upside the cast are great and almost completely carry the movie, especially Margot Robbie's enthralling performance as Nellie. And as with Chazelle's previous work the set pieces are well executed and (some) characters are memorable.
However, these positives could not completely overcome the movie's fundamental flaws which are -- going too far with trying to revolt the audience (to the point of childishness), not spending enough time with the characters or important scenes despite its decadent runtime, and the ending coming off as completely pretentious in the context of how practical/cynical everything leading up to it was.
In the end, Babylon does serve its purpose as an entertaining spectacle, but like the Hollywood it critiques, its self-indulgence prevents it from achieving greatness."
BABYLON,"A scabrous, ambitious, Ken Russell-esque love (and hate) letter to cinema ""Babylon"" tracks the career of Manny Torres, an aspiring filmmaker from Mexico who crosses paths with fellow aspiring starlet Nelly LaRoy at a bacchanalian party one night in 1920s Los Angeles. The film also follows several other characters at the same party, including movie star Jack Conrad, cabaret performer Fay Zhu, tabloid journalist Elinor St. John, and musician Sidney Palmer, as each rise and fall in their respective careers spanning the end of silent films and the beginning of sound productions; each of the characters cross paths throughout as they navigate the shifting business of Hollywood.
This large-scale epic from Damien Chazelle is, in a word, ambitious, both in scope and mere technicality. It opens with an utterly ravishing, debaucherous party sequence that captures the maddening spirit of roaring twenties Hollywood, setting a visual bar that is fairly high. While there are a number of fantastic sequences throughout the film, this key party sequence where each of the characters are introduced/first intervene is, without a doubt, the highlight of the film. While its characters are fictional, the screenplay blends them in with passing names of real-life historical Hollywood figures, as well as thinly-veiled references to others.
Firstly, it almost goes without saying that ""Babylon"" is gorgeously photographed. The performances are also uniformly solid. Diego Calva is a likable presence as the centerpiece character, while Margot Robbie's portrayal of the brash and troubled Jersey girl flying by the seat of her pants is comical and poignant by turns. Brad Pitt fittingly plays the drunken but goodhearted movie star, and Jean Smart is also a welcome presence as the curt and astute gossip columnist, ostensibly based on Louella Parsons (or a writer of her ilk).
The film is consciously over the top, at many points capturing the madcap spirit of something the late Ken Russell would have directed. Its first three quarters are particularly outstanding, and demonstrate the realities (and technicalities) of how the transition from silent films to motion picture talkies posed legitimate, career-altering (or more often, career-destroying) challenges for nearly everyone who was part of the business. Chazelle projects this theme to the audience in one memorable and protracted sequence in which Robbie's character (along with the sound man) struggles, fails, is interrupted, and struggles again to perform a simple one-page scene. The nuts and bolts of these logistical challenges in a then-fledgling industry are perhaps the most intriguing components of the story, highlighting just how vastly different (and more arduous) the process was of making a sound picture for the actors and filmmakers accustomed to the established ways.
By the time it reaches its final act, however, the viewer does get the sense that the project is beginning to implode under its own weight to some degree; the focus on certain characters ebbs and flows, and the film begins to lose some steam. It is revived somewhat by an insane sequence in which Torres and another crew member of his film studio (in an attempt to save LaRoy from reckless gambling decisions) cross paths with an eccentric crime boss played by Tobey Maguire, and journey into a subterranean gathering place for the city's debaucherous denizens, who have literally gone underground following the more reserved moral code of the 1930s. The garish and ghoulish sequence feels like a tour of Dante's Inferno (probably quite intentionally), and is almost more madcap than the opening party sequence.
The film grinds to a somewhat abrupt halt as each of the characters' lives and careers face further significant devastation in the last thirty minutes, and the sense of tragedy that one might expect to feel is strangely absent, perhaps because these characters are in and of themselves larger than life, even cartoonish at times; still, I felt that there was an emotional core missing as their stories are resolved. The film ends on a profoundly cynical note, showing Hollywood as a place that metaphorically devours its own, only to be constantly replenished by the unending stream of those who make pilgrimage there, seeking to etch their mark in the tapestry of cinema. The observation is astute, and the implications are splashed across the screen in a century-spanning montage of snippets from the earliest films to contemporary ones.
All in all, ""Babylon"" has many strong points: Mainly its visuals, sturdy performances, and focus on the industrial realities of early filmmaking that most 21st-century viewers would take for granted. It eventually grows a bit long in the tooth into its third hour, and loses some tenacity, but not enough so that the film entirely collapses in on itself (though it comes close). If nothing else, it earns its keep as an ambitious and scabrous love (and hate) letter to cinema. 8/10."
BABYLON,"Margot is all in! Greetings again from the darkness. It's 1926 and a movie mogul is planning yet another massive debauchery-filled industry party at his palace of a home in still-developing Bel-Air, California. Lest we have any doubt that this party is over-the-top, we are forced to witness the handlers of the main attraction - a circus elephant - get sprayed from the wrong end as they push the colossal beast up the hill. Once the party starts, things get even crazier. Orgies, drugs, nudity, wild dancing, and a golden shower and drug overdose in the room of a Fatty Arbuckle type ... yes, this opening party sequence lasts 20-30 minutes, and occurs before the opening credits. The only touch of class is the old school Paramount logo.
Writer-director Damien Chazelle (Oscar winner, LA LA LAND, 2016) sets the stage for his wild and frenzied epic meant (I think) as a tribute to early Hollywood and the uneasy transition from silent films to talkies. Of course, that topic has been handled in other prestige films - recently with THE ARTIST (2011), as well as the classic SINGIN' IN THE RAIN (1952). It's the latter which serves as a template or guidepost for Chazelle, to such an extent that he shows clips from it, quotes it, and even has a couple of his characters share similarities with Lina Lamont and Don Lockwood.
From the moment she crashes onto the party scene, this becomes Margot Robbie's movie. Fully engaged doesn't begin to describe how she embodies the Nellie LaRoy character. Nellie is a displaced Jersey girl desperate to break into showbiz, and she pursues stardom with everything she has to offer. Nellie is a risk-taker and literal gambler, and the character is supposedly inspired by the infamous Clara Bow. It's at that first wild party where she meets both Jack Conrad (Oscar winner Brad Pitt) and Manny Torres (Diego Calva). Conrad is a huge silent movie star, and also a boozing womanizer with the accompanying swagger (supposedly based on actor John Gilbert). Manny, though a much quieter soul, is much like Nellie in that his ambition is to work in the movie business. The two discuss their dreams while tearing into mounds of cocaine.
Nellie's fearlessness in front of the camera (much like Ms. Robbie's) pays off as the offers roll in and she makes her name. She and Manny periodically cross paths as he climbs the ladder towards studio executive. We also keep up with Jack Conrad and his stream of wives, and how things begin to change with THE JAZZ SINGER and the advent of talking motion pictures. While all this is happening, the film also (sorta) follows the career of jazz trumpeter Sidney Powell (Jovan Adepo) as he builds a career as a black performer on screen. One of the more interesting characters who we wish had more screen time is Lady Fay (played by Li Jun Li). We are rarely treated to a Chinese lesbian chanteuse, and she makes each of her scenes quite fascinating.
Others in the cast include Olivia Wilde as one of Jack Conrad's many wives, Lukas Haas as an industry guy, Eric Roberts as Nellie's hustler dad, Pat Skipper as William Randolph Hearst, and Max Minghella as the legendary Irving Thalberg. They are each fine, but none as memorable as Tobey Maguire (also a producer on the film), who has a funny/creepy cameo as a fictional giggling gangster named James McKay. However, it's Jean Smart as Elinor St John, a gossip columnist in the mold of Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons, who has the film's best scene when she deals the hard truth to Jack Conrad. Ms. Smart seems to excel in every role she takes these days, and this may be one of her best, albeit with limited screen time.
The issues with the film have nothing to do with its entertainment value and outrageous moments or with the performances. Each of those things keep us watching. It's only when we stop and think about it when the problems come into focus. Most blatant is the love story between Manny and Nellie. They actually spend very little time together after their cocaine feast. Certainly not enough to fall in love. There is a 'blackface' scene unlike anything you've seen before, and in 3 hours and 8 minutes director Chazelle follows up the projectile elephant poop with vomit from a drug overdose, vomit from something other than a drug overdose, a urine stream, and rattlesnake venom. At times it seems like he wanted to see just how much he could get away with.
Chazelle collaborators from LA LA LAND include cinematographer Linus Sandgren composer Justin Hurwitz, and Film Editor Tom Cross, all three are Oscar winners from that film, and all provide superb work here. The technical aspects of the film are terrific, it's as a story (or stories) where things unravel. It's simply bloated and overly ambitious, while having some of the frenetic pacing of Baz Luhrman's MOULIN ROUGE! Or THE GREAT GATSBY. It appears filmmaker Chazelle is attempting to reinforce cinema is art as a spectacle, when most of us don't require more proof. The movie montage at the end is fun to watch, but strikes this viewer as a bit indulgent after a long movie. Buckle up for a wild ride and enjoy to good stuff.
Opens in theaters on December 23, 2022."
BABYLON,"Uh, NO, not a good movie Oh my God I could not make it through 1/3 of this movie. After 20 minutes I felt like I have been watching for an hour and a half only to be disappointed that I had two hours plus to watch. The insanity of this is made up Hollywood world is just way too much to take and way too much to be enjoyable for someone trying to watch a movie. You can only fill a movie with so many stars and have it have no plot and so much spasmatic energy that it becomes just unwatchable. Maybe it's because I'm in my 40s and I don't care to hear so much blaring screaming and absolute chaos just to make a film seem like it's an art. Skip this."
BABYLON,"A cinematic experience Babylon is cinematic marvel that Damien Chazelle is a messy, dazzling epic masterpiece that film hasn't yet accepted or had before. Damien Chazelle has called Babylon: ""A hate letter to Hollywood and a love letter to movies,"" but his messy, dazzling epic doesn't support that simplistic idea. Set in the early days of cinema, when talking pictures were a jaw-dropping phenomenon and Hollywood was still being created, Babylon suggests a deeper reality: the film industry's raw, self-destructive, narcissistic impulses and its glorious, magical results have always been opposite parts of the same whole. Chazelle's ambitions are huge. Babylon is full of remarkable set pieces with richly drawn characters, music, dancing, love and betrayal. The film's strengths more than make up for its serious flaws, including too many endings and a wrong-headed reliance on Singin' in the Rain as a touchstone. But if Babylon makes you groan occasionally, there are many more times long, exhilarating stretches that are mesmerising. In one of the film's multiple endings, which leaps ahead to 1952, a major character sits in a cinema tearfully watching Singin' in the Rain. That enamoured-of-movies scene hasn't been fresh since Sullivan's Travels in 1941, not to mention Cinema Paradiso in 1988 and this year's Empire of Light. The fact that the scene can be viewed as a homage to all those films doesn't make it less cliched. And a montage of other movies through history is a bravura but needless coda. At its best, Chazelle's film is a cinematic marvel, evidence enough that movies are magical, as it sweeps us into the beautiful, terrible world we recognise as Hollywood even now. The cast up and down Babylon is amazing and almost eerily in sync with my own tastes. Actors I deeply love, like Taylor Nichols and Ethan Suplee, show up oh-so-briefly as if casting director Francine Maisler had thumbed through my own mental rolodex and said to herself ""ah, here's another face Sonny would like to see."" This is, perhaps, another reason I found myself drawn in by Babylon's excess: I just liked spending time with almost everyone up on that big, beautiful screen, I fell in love with the cast and the story. Believing Babylon to be over, thus missing the last few of its 189 minutes. This was itself a fitting, almost serendipitous, way to end the movie. Audiences come and go; they are as ephemeral and ever-changing as the names on the marquee. The darkened theater filled with flickering light? That's eternal, everlasting, deathless. The actors and the audiences alike come and go, but the show goes on forever."
BABYLON,Sometimes less is more I can see why the reviews are polarized and why people hate the film. It's a frustrating film at times mainly cause there is so much going on. Right off the bat it's crazy flash and busy tho I enjoyed it at first at the film progressed it gets more busy and busy and then the ending is so busy and goes on and on and on and it doesn't know when to end. That's the main fault of the film is that less is more and that would of helped the film. There is also much characters that the supporting characters don't get enough screen time and story that they seem pointless at times or lost. The acting is amazing especially Margot Robbie who deserves all the praise for the film. I get what the film was aiming at but it just lands where you hate or love it at times. It's frustrating and at times gives you a headache. I overall enjoyed the film at times and thought it was ok though I would not recommended the film.
BABYLON,"It feels like I shouldn't have enjoyed it ... but I did Yes it's a mess. Yes it's way too long. But damn is it fun.
The opening half an hour or so promises so much for the film and it achieves this, not in the way you would think, but in completely different ways. There were times when I thought 'how did we get here?' but you just have to go with it and enjoy the ride.
A lot of people criticise the character development, and I can understand since the movie is 3 hours long and we hardly know anyone's backstories. However, I think it shows how people came and go in Hollywood, fading in and out of anonymity. Others will see it differently which is understandable.
The highlight for me was the ending, which felt like a major love letter to cinema and the progress of film up to the modern day. Despite the decadence and excess in the culture, the production was ground-breaking. It even moved me a little bit, which surprised me for a film that is such a hot mess.
I really enjoyed the score as well, it was nice and playful, adding an extra lavish touch to the tone of the film. Those little trumpet riffs will be stuck in my head for a while."
BABYLON,"Decadent, Depraved And Tasteless This movie shows how spoiled rotten actors are. They get paid massive amounts of money to pretend to be someone they are not. They drink and drug excessively. They have outrageous and decadent parties all the time. They have all the fame and fortune in the world and it's never enough for them. I honestly don't have too much sympathy for them in many ways. This movie has no actual plot. It's just spoiled actors acting like whiny children. It also is excessively long at over three hours of Hollywood psychosis.
I for one don't worship actors like this movie wants me to. They aren't my gods. They are just people who get paid way too much for their profession. Hollywood was depraved back in the 20's and it still is now. I don't need to be reminded of that."
BABYLON,That was awful. 
BABYLON,"Adding up all the good parts, 20 minutes out of the 190 are great "
BABYLON,"Felt like scrolling through TikTok I really want to understand what the producers thought. Who is the audience? It seems like another movie made for Hollywood bubble by Hollywood bubble. Actually It was not a movie -It was a mix of random scenes. 90% of them were pointless aka snake scene (WTF?) Définition of cringe with Jokes that don't land well but made embarrassed anyone who is slightly intelligent.
There are No developed characters. No true motives no dilemmas. I have never seen so many people walking off ever, half way through I wanted to leave as well but hoped at least for a surprising ending - nope, the ending and the connection to the "" cinema paradiso "" was cliché and laughable. In a certain moment I thought it was badly done on purpose as they wanted to do it as in 30s. Like Ed Wood movie. That would be cool, but again such a disappointment
One very dramatic scene with Brad Pitt was so predictable, people at the audience laughed out loud they couldn't stand how ridiculous it was and how predictable.
I had high hopes, left disappointed and with 3h of my life wasted."
BABYLON,"I thought it was great! Personally, I'm a sucker for movies about old school Hollywood. The film is a satire on the transition between silent films and ""Talkies"" as they were called. If you like film as much as I do those moments are too cool. The frustration of adding sound to your movie by filmmakers use to the freedom that was given without the new technology and how this new technology effected the movie stars of the time. There are still some people on this earth (but not many) who completely understand what a game changer sound was to Hollywood and I thought the film captured that Brilliantly.
Babylon had an impressive ensemble cast lead by Margot Robbie. There were a few stories going through the movie and they intertwined really well. Never a dull moment at all, and thanks to the ensemble cast we got to touch on a lot of subjects that was Old School Hollywood. Socialism, racism, ageism, sexism. An all across the broad look just showing you how it was
And speaking of never a dull moment, going into this, I thought this movie was just going to be about a Hollywood party (technically, you can say the movie is about keeping the party going). The movie is long but it worth it because those scenes where they showed you how Hollywood Partied almost 100 years ago. You could never get away with that kind of epicness now.
Plus, it was a visually stunning film too. Enjoyable from beginning to end."
GREEN BOOK,"I Was Captivated I saw Don Shirley perform in college in 1966. At the time I simply thought he was a hell of a pianist, using that bass and cello to come up with a unique sound. So when this movie came along, I thought ""I saw that guy!"" I know the critics are being hard on this film, but I sat for two hours, totally captivated. I know there are stereotypes. Could that be because the repeated actions against minorities and the actions of racists have become so commonplace they seem like stereotypes. I believe the performances of these two fine actor made the show. There is a subtlety to this movie that transcends many others of its type. Yes, there are Southern cops; yes, there are men's rooms that are off limits; yes, there are simplistic views of racism by white New Yorkers. But what I got was a realistic presentation of an evolving friendship. Shirley is abrasive and self-centered; Lip is clueless most of the time. And I believed in them. See this film."
GREEN BOOK,"A captivating watch, with sensational acting. Not often these days so I give ten stars to a film, with Green Book however, I had no other choice, this film had me totally captivated.
It's a fascinating story, I had no idea that it was based on true events, temporarily losing his job at a club, Tony Lip Vallelonga gets a job driving for Doctor Don Shirley. Shirley has a specific reason for touring in the deep south.
It's one hell of a journey (I know it's a term that's easily bandied about in films, but it's appropriate here,) physically and emotionally, it's a battle of wills, ideas, concepts, each man learns something from the other. You see the true horror of what Shirley faced in day to day life, from buying a suit, to eating dinner.
The acting, is simply outstanding, you couldn't put a pin between Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, the pair are unbelievable in this film, it's no wonder awards came flooding in.
It looks sensational, they brought 1962 to life, and the music throughout is spot on.
I laughed, I sobbed, I connected, a cinematic triumph, Green Book is an incredible film. 10/10."
GREEN BOOK,"Green Book This film proves why movies can be so powerful with a touching, poignant and some times funny story of opposites attract. Enjoyed every moment although it isn't always easy to watch. Mortenson and Ali shine and there are strong supporting roles as well."
GREEN BOOK,"Ranks #5 on my IMDb Top 25 Best Buddy Films List. A Feel Good Movie at its Core Ignore the sour grapes criticism from Spike Lee. This was THE best film of 2018, and one of the best-ever feel-good buddy/road films. There is something very sincere about this film - it is understated in its messaging, and keeps the focus on the evolving bond and respect that grows between two polar opposite personalities. A well-made film, with first-rate acting, that makes you feel this good without feeling ""manipulated"", is a rare treat indeed. Highly recommended."
GREEN BOOK,"""Green Book"" is Gold We loved Green Book along with the sold-out crowd who applauded loudly at the end. Based on true story of piano virtuoso, Don Shirley's road trip through the south during the 60's, the film pays tribute to his genius and courage as a black man who tries hard to soar above the ugliness of the times. The elegant trappings of his home and his success as a concert pianist leave him arrogantly cold and lonely, but his life begins to change when he hires Tony as his road trip driver. With a history as nightclub bouncer with Mafia connections in New York, Tony is the antithesis of Don's perfection and their evolving relationship on the road makes the movie soar above the ordinary and become magical. Viggo and Ali in the main roles are remarkable, and it's funny and endearing to watch them discard stereotypes and discover their mutual humanity. What we liked best is the movie teaches without preaching, it all unfolds through a myriad of natural moments between two great actors and a strong supporting cast. Top all this off with a really good soundtrack, excellent direction and production values, and an audience that laughed out loud and vigorously applauded at the end...this one is a true 10!"
GREEN BOOK,"A perfect example of Yin & Yang - and black and white has nothing to do with it. Outstanding true story film showing that color doesn't define us, but how we act ourselves and towards others, does.
Great performances from the entire cast, especially Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali who were perfectly cast and convincing in their roles. It was also great to see comedian Sebastian Maniscalco in this film as well.
Writer, director and producer Peter Farrelly nailed every aspect of this biography.
The score, cinematography, sets and visuals were all on point.
I'm not a fan of slow paced long films, but this was was close to an exception. I feel if the pace was picked up a bit and/or the 130 min run-time edited down to around 110 mins, this would have been a perfect 10 from me.
Excellent drama and comedy perfectly positioned throughout the film.
A well deserved 8/10 from me."
GREEN BOOK,"A review as a respons to other (negative) reviews. I understand why a lot of critics don't like this film, but at the same time I feel like they're making up their minds about what they think the movie is - or should - be about. They (who disagree with the film) will say that it diminishes the horrors that the black community faced in America during the 50's - and because of that they think it's a bad film. But I thought it was a good film; in my opinion it's not a movie about Shirley and his struggles facing ruthless racism - it's about Tony Lip's psychologically reforming journey changing his mind about black people through the witnessing of Shirley's experiences. And it's that central story line the critics are disagreeing with and eschews the whole film on the premiss that it should've been about something else (Shirley journey - not Tony's).
There are thousands - if not millions - of films about racism towards black people and their culture, and Green Book had a different perspective than the rest of them - by not focusing on the racism but on how the racism changed a man who wasn't a target of it. But that's obviously a big no-no according to these critics.
To me Green Book is about a white man thoroughly changing his whole mindset about something that he'd been conditioned to abide to his whole life."
GREEN BOOK,"""It takes courage to change people's hearts."" "
GREEN BOOK,"A re-awakening journey My main reason for watching 'Green Book' was due to me wanting to see as many 2018 films as possible, and that it had won the Best Picture Oscar (so naturally wanted to see too that it was that good). Like Viggo Mortensen as an actor, the film's concept was appealing and it looked appetising. Word of mouth, including from very trusted friends online and in real life, was very positive so there were plenty of other reasons too.
'Green Book' turned out to be when watching a very good film and nearly a great one with many fantastic things. Wouldn't go as far to say that it is my favourite film of 2018, and as far as the other Best Picture nominees go there was a preference for 'Roma' and 'The Favourite', but if to put it in a group of either best, solid middle and worst films of the year 'Green Book' would be closest to being in the best category of those three groups. It is a very, very well done film and its good intentions are evident throughout and noble.
It could have done with more grit in places, really do appreciate that it was trying not to be heavy-handed or trying to offend with a quite heavy theme but they could have done more with it and given a little more depth to what there was. Not saying it wasn't there, quite the contrary, just wish there was more.
Credit is due for the laudable and successful efforts in making the story accessible and it is one that easy to like and get into, but actually it could have afforded to do a little more risk-taking and have a little more complexity.
Viggo Mortensen though brings a lot of charm and entertainment value to his role, and Mahershala Ali is a dignified and very moving contrast. Their chemistry is wholly natural and beautifully irresistible (never feeling contrived or rushed) which provides a lot of 'Green Book's' heart, while their characters are more than just characters and instead feel very human. This is very different territory for director Peter Farrelly and it is surprisingly restrained direction from him and it suits the material very well. It's a lovely looking film too and affectionately photographed, while the music is beautifully chosen and fitted some nice nostalgic song choices here.
The script is thoughtful, charming and also moving, and regardless of anybody feeling that it is a little too accessible and could have done with more grit the story kept me riveted and left me moved, inspired and like my heart had been warmed. The YMCA scene is a powerful one and a character development turning point handled beautifully.
Summing up, one of those very good and nearly great films. 8/10"
GREEN BOOK,"Critic-proof festival hit should be big holiday winner Some of my movie friends were stunned when I mentioned in a thread that this was my ""People's Choice Award"" vote for TIFF 2018 (it won, btw). I generally go for weightier fare, so my being won over by a PG-13 road film with the familiar ""they-couldn't-have-been-more-different"" premise directed by the auteur co-responsible for such recent classics as ""Dumb and Dumber To"" and ""The Three Stooges"" elicited a virtual double-take.
But I couldn't help it ... it really WAS the best film I saw (out of 17), and far and away the most entertaining. I think this is largely because it's based on a real-life story about the beginning of a lifelong friendship - a story that has writing participation by the son of one of the real-life characters. There's definitely an air of authenticity to the events as they unfold that could never occur with a purely contrived plot. Consider: A college-educated concert pianist of Jamaican descent hires a temporarily-unemployed Italian-American nightclub bouncer who's streetwise but academically dim to drive him to venues in the Deep South back in 1962. That's not a setup that a Hollywood script written from scratch would ever have come up with.
The two lead actors really click. Mahershala Ali makes a nice Oscar follow-up playing the aloof pianist passenger to Viggo Mortensen's ""b.s. artist"" driver. Ali is certain to get another nomination; Mortensen's performance may be a little too broad to garner one, but he delivers exactly what's called for. And he makes a believable Italian-American, which is impressive considering that he's Danish.
I'm allergic to preaching and heavy-handedness in movies no matter what the message, and with the exception of one borderline scene, I'd say that the movie nicely sidesteps these proclivities that surface so often in socially-conscious films.
The music and FX are excellent. When an actor plays a piano player, there's always the challenge of making the playing look believable. It doesn't get any better than it gets here - Ali's piano playing is every bit as convincing as Margot Robbie's ice skating in I, TONYA. You never see a disconnect between hands and body as he's filmed against a variety of backgrounds. And if I could bet on an Oscar win right now, it would be Kris Bowers for Best Original Score. (He also supplies Ali's hands, which should clinch it.)
Top everything off with a Capra-esque Christmas Eve finale and a closing line that sends everyone home smiling, and it all adds up to a monster hit. Its commercial payoff could be huge - the movie practically begs for a TV series spinoff, and the real-life characters remained friends until they both died in 2013.
So congratulations to Peter Farrelly on his graduation from co-directing lowbrow fare to solo-directing middlebrow (i.e. mass-appeal) fare. You can't deny the talent and craftsmanship it takes to make a mainstream movie that works as well as this one does."
GREEN BOOK,"Not to say it isn't a decent movie... ... just that it's so inoffensive, safe, and cliche that I feel like I've seen it a million times before. Mortensen and Ali are terrific actors, and I am thankful for them. Without their charisma (and Viggo's willingness to shove insane amounts of food down his throat), I fear Green Book would be dead on arrival.
Mostly, I think this is a movie that's desperately afraid of 'offending' anyone. For instance: if there's a scene with racist cops, there will also be a scene with a good cop down the road, just to make clear that the movie is not stating or suggesting that 'all cops are/were racist'. It's also funny that the good-cop scene happens in the snow, to let us know the characters are back in a blue state, where supposedly life wasn't so bad for a black man after all! This is one of the many simplistic moves that indicate to me that the filmmakers were willing to sacrifice the complexities of their themes for a feel-good entertainment.
The script wants both characters to 'learn' from each other and eventually change and grow, but to make this happen, it turns them into unrealistic caricatures. It's a bit frightening how Shirley is portrayed as a complete ignorant of black culture, but it had to be this way so Tony can be the one to 'introduce' him to it. Tony's transformation comes simply from witnessing racism first hand, as if he never experienced such a thing in his life before - maybe another consequence of this being a blue state-red state movie??
So besides the performances, that speak for themselves, I think it's a very uninspired effort. At one point the characters leave the car for no reason other than to have a dramatic confrontation in the rain, as if rainy night equals 'dramatic weight'. I saw it in a packed movie theater and people seemed to enjoy it. You can't blame them. The movie has a 'now everything's fine' conclusion that can leave audiences in a good state of mind - but it also shows how simplistic it really is."
GREEN BOOK,Are We There Yet? A journey of reawakening in a Country like ours - Gore Vidal called it the United States Of Amnesia - the absurdity of the behavior in the Southern communities even the kindest ones have a jarring effect. Viggo Mortensen is sheer perfection as the all American Italian. The opening of his heart and of his mind is a total joy and Mahershala Ali provides another magnetic character to his already rich list of magnetic characters but what makes this film fly so high is the humanity that Mortensen and Ali infuse their characters with. I loved them and Green Book provided me with one of the most satisfying endings of 2018. It leaves you with the hopeful thought that perhaps we're not there yet but that we are on our way. Happy New Year!
GREEN BOOK,"Finally...Well-written, well-acted Movie This picture should be up for BEST PICTURE. It has everything: great acting, solid script-writing (something that Hollywood really needs), and lots of humor. I wish that Hollywood would make more pictures like this."
GREEN BOOK,"Greatful to have seen this I saw this at the premier at TIFF and was thrilled to learn the story is about a real friendship. This is not a typical road movie, or buddy film. Given the lead actors, I knew it would be something special, and it is. Entertaining, funny in parts, hard to accept in others - as a white american who wasn't around in the 1960's, the racism was mind boggling and I couldn't help but feel shame. Green Book has so many layers - family, culture, honesty, dignity, genius, respect, acceptance, stereotypes, racism, music, class, friendship, and fried chicken. Whatever your views, race, or age - this film is not 'preachy', but you should appreciate an honest portrayal of a difficult time & place in history. I'll use the term an ""unlikely friendship"", but knowing the two men were real makes it fantastic. I'm so grateful to have learned about them and their lives. I only wish there had been a Q&A afterward."
GREEN BOOK,"America in the Early 60´s In 1962, the Italian-American Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) is as family man happily married with children with his beloved wife Dolores (Linda Cardellini). When the night-club Copacabana where he works as a bouncer closes for two months to be refurbished, Tony needs to find a two-month job to support his family. He accepts to become the driver of the classical Afro-American pianist Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) in a tour with two other Caucasian musicians through the racist South of America. He receives a Green Book, a travel guide with references of safe locations to black people and along their journey, they develop friendship and respect for each other.
The Oscar winner ""Green Book"" is a great film that discloses the racial segregation in the early 60´s in America. The touching story of friendship and injustice has magnificent performances of Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. The screenplay blends drama, music and comedy and is based on a true story. ""Green Book"" is a film that really deserves the Oscar. My vote is nine.
Title (Brazil): ""Green Book: O Guia"" (""Green Book: The Guide"")"
GREEN BOOK,"A delightful road movie with terrific performances from both of its actors Green Book is a comedy-drama film directed and co-written by Peter Farrelly (Dumb & Dumber, There's Something About Mary). Starring Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, it is a delightful road movie with terrific performances from both of its actors.
In 1962, New York bouncer Frank ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) is looking for extra money after the nightclub he works at closes for renovations. Thanks to one of his friends, Tony lands a job as a chauffeur for ""Doc"" Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), a talented African-American pianist embarking on a concert tour of the American Deep South. Due to the strong animosity against African-Americans in the Deep South, Tony is required to take on extra work along the way as he is also required to use his skills as a bouncer to protect Doc and ensure he has a safe journey with his band.
Heartfelt and funny, Green Book takes what could have been another generic road trip movie and turns it into one of the most interesting depictions of an otherwise unlikely friendship. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali have superb chemistry with each other and the film's witty screenplay frequently had me looking forward to every moment of dialogue between both of them, especially during the driving scenes. The film also does a fantastic job of establishing the prejudiced atmosphere of the American Deep South in the 1960s without making its citizens seem too much like caricatures of typical white supremacists. Director Peter Farrelly near-flawlessly balances the film's comedy and drama, which is surprising as he is primarily known for his work only in the former genre. He has certainly shown he is more than capable of handling films like this and I am hopeful he can keep this up in any future projects he may end up involved in.
I rate it a solid 9/10"
GREEN BOOK,"Very authentic This is a nice movie with a very authentic story behind it. Both lives of the genius composer-musician, and his once driver tough-Italian guy, who ended up acting in mafia movies and series from Godfather to Sopranos, together with his son who won 2 Oscars, are very interesting, and the story has its authenticity to stand as its greatest strength. This is how it was in the 60s. Well acted it gives a piece of that atmosphere, it is not the most stylistically innovative movie, but it is not the point. The story, which comes-off initially as anti-Italian, wins you over slowly by its charm, and the fact that it was written by Italian son of one of the protagonists, reveals that it is sincere and gently self-mocking, but with the heart in the right place, exactly like the unlikely duo - not perfect, but entirely and heartwarmingly human. In the writing since the 80s, it gives 0 fs about the PC hyst eria, and can in fact teach our dear ment ally deficient woke friends what is the true face of disc rimination and how the real life heroes of the 60s, that they would in their stup ididty surely despise, in fact look like."
GREEN BOOK,"heart's in the right place It's 1962 New York City. ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) is a nightclub bouncer and a tough guy ingratiating himself with gangsters. When his workplace gets shut down for a two month renovation, he gets a job driving peculiar classical pianist Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) to his concerts in the deep south.
There are issues but the movie has its heart in the right place. I don't mind the racist Tony Lip finding redemption and friendship in Shirley. Viggo is doing it pretty broadly but the main problem is Shirley. There are scenes where Farrelly is desperate for humor but it only heightens my disbelief. First is the cringeworthy KFC. It's crazy that a man has never had fried chicken despite coming from the south. The point should have been that he prefers not to eat fried chicken (and watermelon and collard greens and grits). It's not that he doesn't like it. He avoids it to avoid his roots. The same goes for the music. He's a musician for heaven's sake. Maybe he's not up to date but he had probably studied aspects of modern music and he's probably met a few of those artists. It's all wrong. His broadly played homosexuality is also a little awkward. I was really scared where Farrelly was taking that until it was saved by Tony who as a nightclub bouncer claims to have seen it all. It's a nice surprising twist to his character and in keeping with his transactional nature. Even the letter writing could be improved if some forethought had occurred. There is no reason why Dolores would go gaga over the letters when she suspects that it's Shirley's writing. She should hold back on the affection with the other girls going gaga. Only when she gets the house letter does she goes head over heels. It would show that she knows him best. These little nagging issues keep the movie from being great although I still enjoyed it."
GREEN BOOK,"Easy to digest and heartwarming feelgood movie While you could argue if the topic raised in the movie is really suited for a feelgood movie such as this, when the credits rolled, I could wholeheartedly say yes.
For once it's not dark, gloomy and preachy drama about America's 1960's racism. No, this is an uplifting and hopeful tale of two men, getting closer together and evolve beyond the beliefs they have been brought up with or the semi-hardcoded (mis)conceptions of things that simply are a certain way for them, mostly because of groupthink and indirect group pressure to behave a certain way.
The acting is strong and I especially liked Viggo Mortensen's portayal of Tony Lip, even if he came across as a bit of a caricature at times. The same issue I had with a couple of supporting characters.
Mahershala Ali gives an equally strong performance, even though his character has some small flaws when it comes to believability.
I found myself being able to easily ignore any flaws because I just really liked the movie as a whole.
The story is easy to digest and despite the topic, not very deep, but that is fine. We know what it is about, and that is more than enough in this case. It also knows when it's a tearjerker and it's not ashamed of it.
You can top it all off with beautiful classical and sixties era music.
All in all, a very entertaining and loveable movie. 9/10, well deserved."
GREEN BOOK,"A good old-fashioned feel-good movie If ""Green Book"" does win the Oscar for Best Picture, as some people think it might, then I for one won't complain. There are, of course, better pictures, (""Roma"" and ""The Favourite"" to name two), but this extremely well-made, nicely directed, intelligently scripted, (if at times a little too obvious in its heart-tugging sentimentality), and very well acted movie ticks all the boxes. It's a feelgood film of the old-fashioned kind that can look back at the bad old days of segregation rather smugly from its 21st Century perspective without feeling particularly smug.
It's a movie about how two mismatched people, (a chain-smoking, rough speaking Italian-American and an African-American you might even call 'uppity'), who, on a long road trip in the Deep South in the early sixties, bestow on each other the gifts of friendship and humanity. Even if you knew nothing of the 'true' story of the musician Don Shirley and his driver you can predict the outcome from the get-go. Of course, it also helps that it's also very funny despite the seriousness of the material and that leads Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are so damn good, (Ali's second Oscar in three years looks like it's already in the bag). It is, then, something of a treat and might even convince you to seek out the music of Don Shirley."
GREEN BOOK,"The film, Mortensen n Ali, they all deserve an Oscar. This film is about the real-life friendship formed between an African American n an Italian bouncer during a road trip thru the Jim Crow South n the Sundown towns during the racial segregation period. Mortensen was convincing as the family-devoted, street-smart bouncer with a fat belly. By the way his appetite was awesome. Ali convincingly portrayed the loneliness n his eyes subtly channelized emotions of sadness. The film dealt with many issues without being preachy. Apart from the film's important message, the acting by the leads r top notch. Mortensen n Ali shud be given Oscars for their performances. One of the best part is the ending which takes place on a Christmas meal."
GREEN BOOK,"Fantastic film, another music themed Oscar nominee Just caught this as the surprise film of the London Film Festival. Such a well written drama with heart, soul and comedic touches, brilliantly performed by the two main actors, and given such an authentic 1962 shiny look to the film by the production designer and cinematographer. A truly great true story with themes that all audiences can connect with - namely, music, family, race, sexuality, friendship and love - and Viggo Mortensen probably gives the performance of a lifetime. Will surely rival A Star is Born at the Oscars in many of the same categories."
GREEN BOOK,"Respect demands respect A very inspiring film. I walked out of the cinema feeling like there is good even in the unlikeliest of people. The dialogue was well written, and the main characters were equally as loveable. Viggo Mortensens acting was only overshadowed by that of Mahershala Ali, whose portrayal of an educated african-american man living in 1960's america was both heartwrenching and absolutely hilarious. While Mortensen stood for most of the comic relief, I found myself laughing the hardest from Ali's deadpan deliveries through the character of Dr. Shirley.
The story of a black man who struggles to gain the respect of his fellow african-americans, while simultaneously resisting and pulling at the roots of the racism and oppression which keeps him from being as successful as the americans and europeans who should be his equals by all measures musical and educational.
While the story and plot left little to be desired. I felt one or two jokes were shoe-horned in and would have been better discarded. The visual tone was fitting to the film, but the camerawork was nothing out of the ordinary. Not all films call for out-of-this-world originality in all marks however. And this film allows the audience to focus on what is really important."
GREEN BOOK,"Simply wonderful in its portrayal of humanity Green Book is a wonderful story of overcoming self-condemnation, and the resulting freedom it provides. As the film begins, Tony is locked in a prison of judgment and rejection, not from any conscious effort on his own but rather his circumstances and environment. As the self-assured and self-aware character of Dr. Shirley is introduced into Tony's life, Tony embarks on a journey of self-discovery in which he is forced to confront his own preconceived notions which ultimately stem from his skewed view of himself. As Dr. Shirley helps Tony to see himself as a man beyond his own limiting thoughts, Tony is finally able to step into his true nature as friend to Dr. Shirley. Everywhere in this film we are reminded that people are complicated, but beyond these complications we are also reminded that everyone is the same, just looking for love and acceptance. The scene where Dolores reads Tony's letter to her cousins is spectacular in this regard. It's interesting that none of the other reviews mention the YMCA scene and aftermath, which for me was the pinnacle moment that the power shifted for these two characters confronting their own strengths and weaknesses. This film is simply wonderful in its portrayal of humanity, and the people we need in our lives. While it comes to light that Tony's wife Dolores is completely aware of her husband's imperfections and shortcomings, she loves him just the same. But it is confrontation, not love, that is necessary to bring about Tony's redemption, demonstrating that the people who spur us to deep, personal growth are never who or what we expect."
GREEN BOOK,"True Stories For Your Soul One of the reasons why I love this movie is simply because we are soooo much more. We as ""Black"" people have rich, intriguing, moving, and funny stories-I hate that we are sitting around waiting for the Next Great Director make movies in which the narratives do more than entertain. I hope Tyler Perry would be one of those innovative directors, but now I don't care who tells it-as long as it gets told. Thank you to the writer and director for such a moving movie that touches more than my funny bone."
LIFE,One of the only recent Hollywood films to scare me 
LIFE,"Turns out astronauts aren't that smart It starts of interesting and moody, then it's suspenseful but 20 minutes in it turns stupid and stays that way till the end. The characters make one stupid decision after another and that takes you out of the movie. After the third stupid decision/action you lose interest. Good actors, great sets, good SFX, crappy script. It's entertaining, but just barely."
LIFE,Goodnight Alien 
LIFE,"Life from Mars Life has a good cast, good special effects but is an imitation of Alien. The characters act with all the intellect of Ridley Scott's prequel Prometheus.
The story is set on the International Space Station as a group of scientists retrieve a soil sample from Mars. It contains a dormant microbe which they they do tests on and which starts to come to life and grow.
As the creature increasingly grows in size and gains intellect it starts to attack the crew one by one. The crew on the other hand make stupid decisions which puts themselves in further danger.
Life is certainly entertaining and wears its influence on its tentacles but the science and story beneath it has little logic."
LIFE,"Solid alien/horror film Life was a solid horror/alien movie with a wonderful cast and well shot visuals. It is not a masterpiece especially considering the genre's many great entries, including the alien which seemed to be something that this film has modelled after.
I liked how this film in contrast to Alien seemed very plausible and realistic, focusing on the 'science' part of sci-fi. The mission in search of extra terrestrial living organisms is a very interesting topic and this film made the possibilities of this seem so much more plausible. At the same time Life also brings up an interesting idea of how little we know about the universe that we live in and how inexperienced we are. How alien life form could be so different to our expectations and hence the debate of whether we should explore and the consequences of human curiosity.
It carried a good amount of intensity and suspense and was gory and terrifying at times.The performances were quite good, the cast is pretty great though so there was no surprise there but it did fall flat in writing though, not that it was poor but it's a very straight forwards and rather clichéd trope that we've seen many times even though it was indeed well done."
LIFE,People didn't like it because the creature didn't seem realistic 
LIFE,"A sleek thrill in space... ""Life"" is one of those type of movies that snuck under my radar. I hadn't even heard about it prior to it being released. And I got the chance to watch it by sheer luck. So of course I did so, because I do love watching movies. And with the likes of Jake Gyllenhaal and Ryan Reynolds on the cast list, what's not to like?
First of all, I must state that the story presented in ""Life"" was actually surprisingly good and interesting. It is the type of movie that creeps under your skin and sticks with you, leaving you wanting to see more.
A Sci-Fi movie is bound to have great CGI, especially if it is a movie that is reliant on proper effects, which was the case of ""Life"". So luckily they had a great budget for the CGI and special effects, and it bore fruit. The CGI was amazing in the movie and it all looked so life-like and realistic, all which definitely contributed to the overall enjoyment and outcome of the movie. Which leads me on to the creature design. Wow. Just wow! I don't know how to explain or detail this, because it is something that has to be seen and experienced with your own two eyes.
""Life"" is a very intense movie experience.
Of course they had a rather impressive cast ensemble to perform in the movie. With the likes of Jake Gyllenhaal and Ryan Reynolds, you know it is going to be good.
This is the type of Sci-Fi movie that combines horror in a nice way, and it is definitely a movie that is well worth investing time and money in, if you haven't already seen it."
LIFE,"Endless trope-fest Revolving weightless camera down spaceship corridor, check. Gratuitous use of lens flares, check. Talking to Earth via video link, check. This thing is packed with sci-fi space film tropes... and that's before the science stuff inevitably goes haywire and the experiment escapes. Cue losing contact with Earth, check. The need for a dangerous space walk, check. Creepy fast growing alien, check. Heroic only one of us can make it, I'll go, no I'll go, check. It really is ridiculous unoriginal twaddle. My TV threatened to go into stand-by mode, with about half a hour to go and I seriously considered letting it. $58 million they spent on this crap, someone should be blasted into space as punishment!"
LIFE,"Good quality sci fi horror Just got back from seeing this and I have to say that I thought it was a really good film.
I see that RT only has it at 65% and it's being made out to be a cheap Alien clone but I think that is doing it a dis-service. I felt it was intelligently made, set characters and situations well and created a palpable sense of tension. Criticism that it's a blatant re-run of Alien are unjustified. Granted, it's about an alien life form in space but that to me is where the similarity ends.
Alien isn't the only scary film set in space that is allowed to be made and if Prometheus is anything to go by, Ridley has no right to be the only person allowed to make sci-fi horror films. It captured well the excitement of discovery, the wonder of space and the precariousness of facing any problems up there.
The effects were good, you could see what was going on, there was unease and dread and it kept me thoroughly absorbed and entertained. I don't want to elaborate anymore for fear of giving away spoilers but if you like a bit of tension with your sci-fi, it's worth checking out. Try to avoid the critic reviews if you can as I think going in a little blind will help your enjoyment."
LIFE,"Not as bad as people make it out to be. The internet is a funny place... it seems to be filled with people who have graduated with 5 Ph.Ds. and clearly seem to be smarter than everybody else (thousands of astronauts and astrophysicists on IMDb apparently). One star rating? Come on... Clearly, you haven't watched enough films to know decent from terrible.
I watched this film without having heard of it (no trailers, spoilers or anything). I'm a sci-fi fan and thought this was a good watch.
I found the characters to lack depth and their actions were questionable at times but the plot was believable and the acting decent. Special effects were good and made the movie believable in my opinion. The movie was well shot and I thought the scenes with the creature were pretty cool.
I don't get how people even compare this movie to ""Aliens""; it's nothing alike. Overall, I thought it was pretty good."
LIFE,So much potential...so little logic... 
LIFE,"Goodnight Moon If the Alien franchise never existed, 'Life' may be considered a groundbreaking movie in the sci-fi genre, but obviously that's not the case. The good thing is, 'Life' doesn't hide the fact that it's clearly inspired by the original Alien film. Because it's extremely well- acted, paced, shot, and structured, the similarities don't really matter. 'Life' is just a heck of a thrilling time at the movies.
I can appreciate original science fiction as much as the next guy, but when you have a film that is as entertaining from start to finish as 'Life', I don't need every scene to be something out of 2001: A Space Odyssey. 'Life' stars Rebecca Ferguson, Ryan Reynolds, Jake Gyllenhaal, Hiroyuki Sanada, Olga Dihovichnaya, and Ariyon Bakare; written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (same guys who did Deadpool); and directed by Daniel Espinosa. There's nothing overtly new or refreshing with any aspect of 'Life', but at the same time, the film fires on all cylinders.
At a brisk run-time of 103 minutes, 'Life' never slows down. It reminded me a lot of 2013's Gravity in that way. The only time these films stopped to breathe was to add subtle but vital character depth to the story. Scene after scene is filled with terror, intrigue, and impressively shot action. It doesn't have the polished cinematography that the aforementioned Gravity or Interstellar does, but what films do? Life succeeds in nicely timed long takes, shocking deaths, and a terrifying creature named Calvin, but it doesn't always nail the emotionally gripping sequences.
However, what struck me most was the film's intelligence. All of the characters acted exactly how I would imagine these particular people would act in real life. Although some choices could be perceived as illogical, you have to put yourself in their shoes. Having an extremely dangerous life form trapped on your spacecraft isn't the most ideal situation, after all.
With stellar performances from the entire lead cast and it's single celled antagonist, 'Life' is one of the best films of the year thus far. Shocking, gruesome, and relentless, 'Life' manages to avoid falling into the forgettable sci-fi territory. It's better than I could have hoped this Alien knockoff would have been. If everything goes accordingly, we will have two great Alien films this year.
+Great cast
+The best Alien film since 1986
+Relentless tension
-Doesn't pack enough emotional punch
9.2/10"
LIFE,"Expect the Expected? Not such an original premise of a sci-fi film, but it seems to tick along ok. The cast and production values are quite good. It's a reasonable viewing mind you, but the climax is more inevitable rather than a twist."
LIFE,"Unbelievable, Illogical and This had the look of a good film.
It had the actors you'd expect in a good film.
But it had a script that was ridiculous, portraying characters that were science/engineering professionals acting like idiots.
It had an 'alien' that was frankly laughable, probably loaned from sponge bob square pants!
Yet another example of Hollywood assuming their audience are idiots, who won't notice glaring and ridiculous plot holes"
LIFE,"Bonechilling, frightening and unexpecting with...empty characters? I'm starting to notice a trend in movies throughout the beginning of the year. Ever since January, we've been getting quite a few different horror/thriller films this year. The results have been mixed to generally positive; Split and Get Out have received positive attention for instance. And now we have Life.
Life is about a group of six astronauts who discover a single cell on Mars. They all research it for a while, the cell grows into a life form, and they discover that the life form is very deadly, and the astronauts must work together to keep it from reaching earth.
I'm going to start with what I didn't like about the movie. My main issue with it has to be the characters. For the most part, they feel very dry and empty. So much so that I couldn't remember a thing about them. There were only two characters who felt like they had any sense of character. The two I'm talking about are Ariyon Bakare's character since he is a scientist and holds a lot of focus in the beginning as the main researcher. Then there's Hiroyuki Sanada's role. His reasoning for wanting to go back to earth makes him the only character I wanted to root for. Aside from that, it's hard for me to care about the movie's characters.
If I were to talk about the things I liked about it, I would like to start with the overall feeling of the movie. After the first act, everything begins to feel tense. There are many tense scenes that have left me feeling horrified, and that's what I believe is the main strength of the movie. If you're going into a thriller movie, you'll expect many intense moments. That's what you get throughout the movie. Something I find very impressive throughout it is that almost the entirety of the film takes place in a space vessel. It's amazing how well it plays into the movie and how well the director, actors and cameraworkers perform their duties and how the movie works so well in such a small, boxed in area. I had my doubts walking in, but what works works really well. Another thing I liked about it was how it ended. I'm not gonna go in-depth with it because that would lead into spoiler territory.
Overall, I thought this movie was very frightening and unexpecting. It had many twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat. However, the movie's weakness would have to be the characters. But I can forgive that with its gripping and thrilling plot."
LIFE,Ignore the hate and give it a go! 
LIFE,"Solidly Entertaining Horror Sci-Fi Had I not seen ""Life"" the same weekend that I also watched ""Alien: Covenant,"" I might have dismissed it as a cheap ""Alien"" rip-off. But because ""Alien: Covenant"" was such a dirty piece of cinematic toilet paper, I ironically ended up liking ""Life"" more than I might otherwise have for coming much closer to giving me the experience of watching an ""Alien"" movie than an actual ""Alien"" movie did.
""Life"" has modest ambitions and meets them admirably, thanks to competent direction, a pretty decent set of actors, and a system of internal logic that follows its own rules. I have no idea how realistically scientific the movie is and don't much care, but the things that happen make sense within the context of the movie, and that's what matters to me. There are some truly disturbing moments -- like one where the alien life form kills off a major character early on by eating him from the inside, or another in which a crew member drowns in her own space helmet -- and the film is paced well. Its twist ending is handled a bit awkwardly and doesn't have as much impact as the filmmaker I think wanted it to have, but overall this is a solidly entertaining way to spend a couple of hours.
Grade: B+"
LIFE,"Life, So Delicate, So Fragile, So Detailed In Terms of Death What is life? That is a question that so many researchers have tried to answer over the centuries. And what better way to try and answer that question than with a Hollywood movie production starring Ryan Reynolds and Jake Gyllenhaal. My last review this weekend is on the movie called Life, a science fiction/horror film hoping to provide the scares of the March season. But will contact with this film give you the chills, or send you running to the ills
with disappointment. Robbie K here with another review. Let's get started!
LIKES:  True Science Fiction  Evolution of the creature  Creepy and horrifying  Good characters
Summary: We know most science fiction movies fall short of the genre, focusing more on the fantasy element and special effects (Star Wars, Star Trek, etc.) Life though hits the genre right on the mark, dropping us amidst an international space station where research about Mars is underway. As the chaos unfolds, the crew has to use their training, knowledge, and science (and not gigantic guns) to try to outwit the beast before it gets them. And speaking of the creature, ""Calvin"" as it is called has an interesting design at the start looking like a fungus. Yet the spores quickly evolve into a deflated looking star fish, and from there began to evolved into a truly destructive creature. Calvin's metamorphosis is perhaps the creepiest aspect of this film, as his search for the crucial ingredients (food, water, and oxygen) drives it to savagery (it will make you look at star fish in a whole new way).
Outside of that though, some other factors that brought the thrills and chills start with the realistic setting. There rendition of the international space station looks pretty close to our own world's, minimizing the fantasy component to keep one ground in the horror the team tries to present, establishing a feeling that this could happen. To go alongside this, the other factor is how alone one feels on the station. Much like the first Alien movie (to which this pays homage to), you feel the isolation of the station as if you are the prey Calvin seeks. This added edge truly brings the horror aspect full circle Finally, the characters also help amplify the horror component of this film. It is nice to see the human cast not be a bunch of idiotic, shallow teens for once, but instead educated scientists fighting for survival (while also not being the single-minded buffoons that often take these roles). The cast was dynamic, each specialized but capable of covering their team members should something happen. Such development led to characters you actually rooted for, instead of against them as we often see in horror films. And the actors all played their roles fantastically, from Ryan Reynolds sarcasm, to Jake Gyllenhaal's scary accuracy in someone with social anxiety.
DISLIKES:  Unneeded dramatic opening  More evolution of the creature  Predictable ending (though nice twist)  Savagery of kills
Summary: A minor dislike I know, but Life's dramatic capturing of the capsule in the first twelve minutes was really unnecessary. All I gleamed from this opening was technical displays and a little excitement to get the mood going. There are probably a few other scenes that could have been left out as well, but these were minor compared to the big stink they made with this opening sequence.
Unnecessary scenes aside, the other thing I would have liked was more development into the creature. Don't get me wrong, the final form was creepy, but after all the changes happening in the beginning (which were a stretch mind you), the team suddenly brought it to a halt. Yes, they tried to explain it via ""science"", but this abrupt halt just broke pace/balance the movie was establishing, which felt a little off for me, right down to the end.
Speaking of ending, Life's trailers hint at what the conclusion is, and based on my observations I had a good idea where it would go. I wanted things to be different, but sadly the ending can be predicted within 30 minutes of the show time (assuming again you haven't watched the trailers). Albeit there was a nice twist to try and throw you off, Life's directors didn't go the full distance to prove my observations wrong.
Yet the biggest beef I have with this movie is the dark, disturbing, savageness the directors instilled. If you're a fan of watching gore filled deaths, suffering, and depressing looks this movie will send ""out of orbit"". For me though, these moments only take away from a movie if done too much or in the wrong manner. My biggest strike comes from the graphic death of a lab mouse (which broke my heart as most animal cruelty does). That's only the start of Life's grotesque hunt as Calvin finds disturbing ways to attack the band of researchers in immense detail. Why the directors felt the need to focus on such disturbances
I don't know, but in this case less would have been more, as the first Alien flick did long ago.
The VERDICT:
Overall, Life is one of the better science fiction, horror films I've seen in years. It drops the grandiose serial killers and idiotic victims, and upgrades to an adapting monster hunting intelligent people. This realism crafts a more suspenseful tale that kept me engaged, while crafting that horrifying atmosphere I love. While most of my dislikes are small, the mutilation involved, alongside some scientific imbalances, really didn't impress me in this movie and the predictable ending didn't necessary wow me as well. Is this worth a trip to theater? If you are looking for a good horror film, then by all means hit the theater for it. As for weak constitutions, skip this one and save some time.
My scores: Horror/Sci-Fi/Thriller: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0"
LIFE,I was scared 
LIFE,"Thought Provoking In A Very Scary Way The critics must be on crack, this is definitely the best violent alien film in a long while. One thing that makes this film stand out among many other similar themed films is the sheer plausibility of it all. Where other sci-fi thrillers like the fairly recent The Martian, or even the original Alien are clearly just over dramatic fantasy type movies, Life seems far more down to earth even in space. Something very similar to this could happen one day you find yourself saying, and that's what makes it extra chilling. Much of the science in this film is very real. In fact we are seeing some of these exact kinds of things this film is concerned with in our very own modern day forests, as the trees, plants, animals and insects continue to change and battle for space/survival.
8/10."
LIFE,"""Life will find a way!"" Some Haters of this Suspenseful and Well Mounted Sci-Fi-Horror, especially those that Cry ""Foul"" because of its ""Alien"" (1979) Roots might not know that the Ridley Scott Franchised Hit was itself Rooted in a B-Movie, ""It the Terror from Beyond Space"" (1958). So let's not Forget to Remember that virtually Everything is Derivative of Something.
Anyway, on its own, this is an Unoriginal, but Satisfying Space Thriller that takes place in a place of Limited Space. The International Space Station. It's the kind of Thing that was Built for this kind of Thing. Nowhere to Run and Nowhere to Hide. Bring on the Monster.
The Movie Looks and Sounds Great. The Superstar Actors like Gyllenhall and Reynolds were not Needed but Welcomed Aboard. The Movie is not in the Least built on Character, it is built to Terrify and Unsettle and that it does.
Overall, Above Average and Better than ""The Martian"" (2015) even with its more Limited Scope and has some Brutal Claustrophobic Carnage. It's Gruesome at Times and Gory, but Never Relinquishes its Tone with Unneeded Jump Scares and Cheap Cop Outs.
It's a Mature Movie that has Wide Appeal Across Audience Demographics. Definitely Worth a Watch, especially for Sci-Fi and Horror Fans. Slightly Underrated."
LIFE,"Solid 'monster in space' movie Set aboard the International Space Station a team of scientists are preparing to analyse soil samples that a probe has brought back from Mars. A single cell is found in the sample; tiny but enough to prove that there is life of non-terrestrial origin. It gradually begins to grow and appears to react to stimuli. The news is greeted with excitement on Earth and the lifeform is quickly dubbed 'Calvin'. Inevitably it isn't long before things go wrong. After an accident in the lab it gets out of its quarantine container and attacks the crew. They struggle to keep it in the lab but it manages to get out and as it feeds it grows. They have to contemplate the fact that their mission is now to stop it getting to Earth rather than merely saving themselves.
Given that this features a deadly alien creature and is set aboard the ISS it is hardly surprising that it is described as 'Alien' meets 'Gravity'; that is a little unfair though. I didn't think it was as good as those films but it didn't feel like a rip-off to me. Even if the central idea wasn't the most original it was effective. Once Calvin is on the loose the tension rises quickly and there are some fairly disturbing moments. The location provides a great sense of claustrophobia and unlike most space based films there is no artificial gravity. There are some questionable moments but occasionally these are required to advance the plot... there wouldn't have been much of a story if they didn't make the mistakes that led to Calvin's escape. The cast, including some big names does a fine job; most notably Jake Gyllenhaal, Rebecca Ferguson and Hiroyuki Sanada. The special effects are pretty impressive; both the realistic space shots and the creature design. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of sci-fi horror; it may not be the best in the genre but it is very far from the worst I've seen."
LIFE,"minor shades of Alien Sho Murakami (Hiroyuki Sanada), Rory Adams (Ryan Reynolds), Miranda North (Rebecca Ferguson), David Jordan (Jake Gyllenhaal), Ekaterina Golovkina (Olga Dihovichnaya), and Hugh Derry (Ariyon Bakare) are six astronauts aboard the international space station orbiting the Earth. They manage to catch the capsule from Mars containing life from the red planet. Derry is able to reanimate the dormant single organism. It grows into a danger to the station and Earth itself.
There are moments of over-reaching while the best of this movie is reminiscent of the classic horror Alien with a good dose of Gravity. It's definitely not quite at those levels. The small alien has a cool look but it could never shakes its CGI construction. The bigger alien has some crawlies goodness. The movie starts with manufactured action that seems overblown in hindsight. The initial experiments is stretching the tension too much and it becomes unreal. There are some poor decisions that go too far. Nevertheless, this creature feature has some good creeps and I like the way the creature attacks. Crushing is not the usual method in a horror and this does it well."
LIFE,Originality Vs. Execution 
LIFE,"Fool about with Alien life, what could possibly go wrong! "
ALIEN,"Holds up as a classic. Alien remains one of the most original, terrifying movies of all time. Compare this with the lame sci fi horrors we get nowadays, 1979, and it still packs a huge punch.
Fantastically atmospheric, chilling and terrifying even now, the story holds up incredibly well. The special effects were incredible for the time, no wonder the franchise is still in demand, though sadly nowhere near the quality of this one or its amazing successor.
The music is fantastic, the direction is incredible, and as for the Alien itself, way ahead of its time. Weaver is phenomenal, but arguably she's upstaged by the creature.
You can't help but remember scenes days after watching it, it definitely has the chill factor.
A cinematic masterpiece. 10/10"
ALIEN,"A Timeless Science Fiction Masterpiece Alien' is one of those special films that have aged very, very well. Even now, after nearly 40 years, everything about it just feels fresh. The restrained, natural performances by the fantastic cast; the outstanding production design; the beautiful, ominous score by Jerry Goldsmith; the realistic, ""lived-in"" look of space-freighter Nostromo's interior: it actually feels less dated than many science fiction films that were made much later, which is quite an astonishing feat. Even the (what now must be considered) ""retro"" technology inside the ship doesn't necessarily have to be viewed as anachronistic in the face of our obvious recent advancements, because it's the most simple technological equipment that is usually robust enough to survive the longest under harsh conditions (like the extreme temperatures in space).
I feel it's especially hard for science fiction films to stand the test of time - which is kind of inherent to the genre I suppose - and 'Alien' simply remains an outstanding achievement in that regard. It's a testament to the talent of everyone involved, but especially to the vision of director Ridley Scott. The film was crafted with so much love for every little detail, and the designs by Moebius, Chris Foss - and in particular the Lovecraftian horrors unleashed by Swiss surrealist H.R. Giger - are among the best and most iconic in any science fiction film. This isn't just an outstanding, timeless piece of entertainment: it's a work of art. 10 Stars out of 10.

ALIEN,"The facehugger scared me as a kid and i still find em creepy. Everything has already been said about this great film n there seems to be little left to say but lemme contribute a lil more by praising how good this film is.
I first saw this in the late 80s on a vhs n as a kid i found it to be a bit slow but was shaken by the chestburster scene.
The facehugger terrified me as a kid.
Revisited all the four parts in the early 2k on dvds which i own.
Revisited this part again few days back as i am on Alien movie marathon n very impatient to check out Prometheus n Covenant.
I feel that this part is inspired by Bava's Planet of the Vampires.
The ruins with the skeletal remains, the design and shots of the ship itself does have the deja vu effect.
This one is atmospheric n dark, gory at times, it has enuff stuff for sci fi fans, it also has slasher n war like tone.
But the best thing is the feminist tone where in this part the women are not being cast as the helpless victims."
ALIEN,One of the best classic sci-fi horror films of all time - A masterpiece 
ALIEN,The Purina Dog Chow company will expand and make a big mistake! 
ALIEN,"Classic horror The further we go in special effects, the more movies show us and ignore the unseen, the more people will return to dark horrors like this one.
It's hard to look at this film without considering the sequels and knowing the alien itself, however when made the alien was mostly unseen and a mystery. It's difficult to forget what you've seen, but it's important to approach this film first if possible rather than joining the series late.
It's amazing that this is over 20 years old - apart from the actors looking so young, the film doesn't feel dated at all. The sci-fi visions here are still bleak and futuristic as they were then - this is not the Star Trek vision of the future. The foreboding exists long before John Hurt spills his secret, Scott's direction is excellent throughout. Once the alien is ""born"" the tension is cranked up and the characters dispatched one by one (a formula we know oh-so well now!)
However here the characters are not merely alien-food but have some dimension to them. Weaver is excellent, while the support cast is full of great support actors (Stanton, Kotto, Hurt, Skerritt, Holm), but of course the real star is the one we see least of.
We barely see the alien in full detail, most of the time it is set in shadows, moving with deadly intent.The alien here is not simply a killing machine as seen in later films but is cruel with it. Witness the alien trap a female crew member and slowly rub up her leg, moving with slow seductive movements before moving with terrifying speed to kill another crew member sneaking up behind it. The slow movements betray the alien's pure cruelty.
The film is a study in terror. It may not be as action packed as the other films in the series but it brings the claustrophobia of being hunted to a new level."
ALIEN,"Sci-Fi Masterpiece Not only is Alien one of the greatest sci-fi films created, it is undoubtedly encapsulates all the best elements of the horror genre too.
The plot is perfect. Simple enough that missed dialogue doesn't throw the audience out of the loop, yet complex enough to demonstrate the depth behind the context. Twists are utilised at the perfect moments to ensure that intrigue remains at a high while tension is at a constant. Characters superb, with no real stereotypes of tokenism added in to no effect.
Visually, the 1979 release is still far more aesthetic than films released 40 years later. The sets are superb, costuming is great, and the lighting to capture the right atmosphere is perfect. Brief glimpses of the Xenomorph establish the fearsome foe without putting everything on show and lessening it's impact, and is a perfect example of why costuming and puppetry done right will always look better than CGI.
An excellent cast, with Weaver's breakout role supported by the likes of Hurt and Holm. Dialogue is delivered realistically and always at the right intensity, and never out-of-step with the perfect directorial pacing.
A phenomenal start to clear franchise material, which no matter how wayward later editions go, will always be a classic. Somehow Alien's sequel matches this performance too."
ALIEN,"A horror classic that has stood the test of time! Still by far the best movie in the series. Alien' while technically science fiction is also one of the greatest horror/suspense movies ever made. Ridley Scott is now one of the most well known and successful directors in Hollywood, but I don't think anything he's made in the last ten years is a patch on this perfect film, which is a near masterpiece in my opinion. In fact, on reflection there are only three Scott movies I genuinely like, those being his first three. The last of these 'Blade Runner' was released twenty years ago now, so to me Scott is long past his use by date. Whatever, 'Alien' itself is a brilliant piece of work, and is almost flawless. Scott's direction is superb and everything else about it is outstanding - a strong script from Dan O'Bannon et al, an evocative score from Jerry Goldsmith, brilliant design and special effects, including the amazing contributions from H.R.Giger, all add up to an amazing movie experience. I also really liked how the cast were character actors and not ""stars"" so there was plenty of suspense generated as to who will live and who will die. This is something very few subsequent movies have done, 'Pitch Black' being one of the exceptions. Sigourney Weaver may be an icon as Ripley now, but when the movie was first released she was virtually unknown, having had a small cameo in Woody Allen's 'Annie Hall' and not much else. The rest of the cast are equally as good. I especially enjoyed Yaphet Kotto ('Blue Collar') and the legendary Harry Dean Stanton ('Wise Blood') as the wise cracking ""below deck"" crew. Many people seem to prefer James Cameron's sequel 'Aliens' over this, but as I much prefer horror and suspense movies to action ones I think this is definitely the better movie, and still the strongest and most effective in the series. 'Alien' is a horror classic and an absolutely unforgettable movie that I can't recommend highly enough. If you haven't seen it before watch it immediately!"
ALIEN,"Classic tale of terror This is one of the finest science fiction films ever made. Everything is so carefully and expertly constructed to the point that repeated viewings are just as good as the first. Also, the atmosphere, along with the amazing sets, is real shocker and few movies have managed to create the same kind eerie feeling.
The story starts with the crew of the cargo vessel ""Nostromo"" waking up before schedule. They soon realize their on-board computer has detected life on a nearby planet and they go to investigate. One of them unwillingly brings back an...ALIEN (!) which soon becomes a very unwanted passenger. The introduction of the title creature in the famous chest-burster scene is a real jolter. Especially if you watch it after dinner.
The music, too, must be mentioned and it moves the story along with unrelenting terror. However, the lack of music, in certain scenes, works just as well and this combination makes for one of the best musical montages to be put on film.
This is a classic film that spawned a series, which is good overall, and a bunch of copycats, many of which are just sad. ""Alien"" came first and it is easily one the best. 10/10
Rated R: violence/gore and profanity"
ALIEN,"Undeniably stunning This was made in the seventies. Seventies. The picture quality is stunning. Undeniably stunning. The sound is perfect except minor issues regarding occasional muffled dialogue. God it looks good. Rivals and beats many films made thirty years later. The blend of suspense, horror, science-fiction is perfect. The budget is perfectly used. Perfect. I say stick with the theatrical version, the various director cuts are not as well paced, add irrelevant scenes and don't fix the one bit that annoys me - the jump cut on Ash's head. Stay theatrical and think of the best film ever made and you would possibly have this. There may be a scant few other films but this would be the first. The ending is so intense and fearful without cheap techniques. I love it. Very minor technical issues are forgotten through fear, fascination and legacy."
ALIEN,"My favourite tagline for a movie ""In space, no one can hear you scream."" This remains my favourite tagline ever for a movie. When 'Alien' was released in 1979, it caused almost as much talk as 'Star Wars' did when released two years earlier. The science fiction genre was being revolutionized at this time and 'Alien' had a horror characteristic to it which was psychological, visually striking and compelling with the type of strength in silence not seen since '2001: A Space Odyssey' in 1968. Definitely a big influence in blockbuster film making, 'Alien' has spawned three sequels so far and is a great horror/science-fiction classic not to be missed. It is director Ridley Scott's best effort on the big screen for making fear the best character in the film."
ALIEN,Iconographic Horror 
ALIEN,"Prophetic & Visionary... Allegorically and quite unintentionally a tale of a virus, ignorantly released its only aim is to destroy us, the wheels set in motion, a search begins for a new potion, but perpetuation has begun and there's absolutely nowhere you can run - from the evolutionary transformations, variations and mutations, the prequels, sequels and unequals yet to come."
ALIEN,A new appreciation of this film's excellence 
ALIEN,The start of a great anthology 
ALIEN,Whose idea was it to bring a cat in the first place? 
ALIEN,"Classic, Classic, Classic. Classic Sci fi, Classic Horror, Classic pacing, Classic visual effects, Classic crew, Classic Android conspiracy, Classic Cat. "
ALIEN,"""Alien"" is not just the monster, it's the atmosphere and the way you feel! In ""Alien"" we follow a seven man crew en-route to earth on board the huge space freighter ""Nostromo"". The crew is in cryosleep, but the on board computer interrupts the journey when a foreign radio signal is picked up. It originates from an uninhabited planet and the crew lands to investigate. There they make contact with an alien life-form...
What makes Alien so great is the constant feel of uneasiness. Right from the beginning you have a feeling that something is wrong. The crew is not particularly friendly towards each other, and you truly feel all the in-group tension. The ship itself is a huge worn out industrial-style maze of halls and corridors, and it feels more like a prison than a place to live. It is as if not only the alien but also the ship itself is against the humans. The Alien itself is the scariest monster in history because it is a ruthless, soul-less parasite completely devoid of any human or civilized traits. The design of the monster is a stroke of genius. Sure it has a humanoid form, but it has no facial traits or anything else which could give away emotions or intentions. Its actions reveals no weaknesses nor civilized intelligence. The Alien is more or less the opposite of everything human and civilized, plus the creature is more well-adapted to the inhumane interior of the ship than the humans who build it. To sum up, you then have a setting where the humans are caught in a web of in-group tensions, an inhospitable ship and the perfect killer which thrives in the ships intestines. You almost get the feel that the humans are the ones who are alienated to each other and to their own ship.
Ridley Scott tells the story with a perfectly synchronized blend of visuals and sounds.
The actors do a superb job, portraying their characters in a subtle but very realistic way. The seven man crew is not a bunch of Hollywood heroes. They are ordinary people with strengths and weaknesses, likes and dislikes. In this way they all seem so fragile when confronted with the enemy.
As mentioned the ship is very claustrophobic and Ridley Scott adds to the eeriness by using camera movement, lights and shadows in an effective way. The living quarters are bright and should be comfortable to the crew, but there is something sterile about it all. The rest of the ship is basically a huge basement.
The music by Jerry Goldsmith underlines the eeriness so well, and the movie wouldn't have worked without his score. Combined with the sounds of the ship it all adds to the uneasiness.
This is not a story about heroic people who boldly teams up against evil. It's a story about ordinary people facing true fear, which is the fear without a face. The fear we can't understand and can't negotiate with, because its only goal is to survive on the expense of us. It's a story where some people bravely fight back whilst others are destroyed by the terror. It's a story where people a killed in a completely random way. There is no higher-order justice behind who gets to live and who dies. All seven characters are just part of a race where the fittest - not necessarily the most righteous - will prevail, and all seven characters start the race on an equal footing. None of them are true heroes, and none of them are true villains.
All the above makes Alien so great as a horror movie. The terror isn't just the Alien itself, it's the entire atmosphere which gets so effectively under your skin, that you just can't shrug it off after the end credits like you can with so many other Hollywood horror movies. The title ""Alien"" doesn't just refer to the monster, it is the theme of the movie and it is the feeling you have during and after the movie. 9/10"
ALIEN,"After 40 years it still scares the hell out of me When I see reviewers ratings less than five I have shake my head in disbelief. Alien set a standard that has yet to be equaled let alone surpassed. I watched it on the wide screen when it was first released, and over a dozen times since. And even though I know what's coming, the hairs on the back of my neck still stand up. What a brilliant work of theatrical genius."
ALIEN,"Visually impressive and exciting Sci/Fi horror , including Oscar-winning special effects This horrifying as well as heart-pounding movie contains shocks , stomach-churning violence , chills , profanity , thrills and results to be pretty entertaining . The commercial vessel Nostromo with a crew in deep-space sleep wakes up and receives a distress call from an unexplored planet . The futuristic cargo ship picks up an unwanted passenger : a malicious extraterrestrial . After searching for survivors, the ill-fated crew heads home only to realize that a deadly bioform has joined them . The merciless alien lives on human flesh and continually changes form . Then the Earthlings have a hard time figuring out the whereabout of the heinous being that is running amok .
This nail-biting picture contains tension from start to finish , gory scenes aplenty , thrills , some strong scares , slime , emotion , entertainment and good acting . It is a superb cinematic combination of Sci-Fi , monster movie and terror . This is a brutal , considerable violent and exciting sci-fi thriller that scales new heights of savagery even by the standards of the 70s and 80s . The result is a throughly violent but undeniably thrilling action movie with a strong cast giving sweatily good value to their abrasive characters . Spectacular as well as bloody slaughter sequences took long time to shoot and were extremely difficult to make . Magnificently designed creature by the artist HR Giger , it was conceptual artist Ron Cobb who came up with the idea that the Alien should bleed acid . Extraordinary as well as astounding special effects in the chestburster scenes , the rumor that the cast, except for John Hurt, did not know what would happen during scenes is partly true and it was filmed in one take with four cameras; for instance, Veronica Cartwright did not expect to be sprayed with blood. The ending part is particularly exciting with Sigourney Weaver battling the malicious alien . ¨Alien¨ is clearly inspired by ¨It ¡ the terror from beyond space¨ . Sigourney Weaver breathes fire into Ripley and remaining actors are all magnificent as the crew of a futurist starship such as Tom Skerritt who is awesome in compelling lead role as commandant , Harry Dean Stanton , Veronica Cartwright , Yaphet Kotto , John Hurt and special mention to Ian Holm . The motion picture was stunningly directed by Ridley Scott who keeps everything bouncing at an absolutely frantic pace . Ridley Scott cites three films as the shaping influences on his movie: George Lucas' Star Wars (1977) and Stanley Kubrick's 2001 (1968) for their depiction of outer space, and Tobe Hooper's Texas chain saw massacre (1974) for its treatment of horror .
It is followed by ¨Aliens ¨, also visually astounding by James Cameron with Paul Reiser , Bill Paxton , Jenette Goldstein , Lance Henriksen ; Alien 3 ¨ in which the alien regenerates and causes wreak havoc on isolated planet prison , being directed by David Fincher with Charles S Dutton , Paul McGann , Charles Dance ; ¨Alien: Resurrection¨ by Jean Pierre Jeunet with Winona Ryder , Dominique Pinon , Ron Perlman , Gary Dourdan and Michael Wincott . All of them starred by the great Sigourney Weaver who performed one of the best female leads created in years . Furthermore, ¨Alien vs. Predator¨ (2004) by Paul Anderson with Sanaa Lathan , Raoul Bova , Lance Henriksen , Colin Salmon , Tommy Flannagan and ¨Aliens vs. Predator 2¨ (2007) by Strause Brothers with Steven Pasquale , Reiko Aylesworth , John Ortiz , Johnny Lewis and Robert Joy ."
ALIEN,"The mother of all movies Back in early 20th century, Lumière brothers didn't have a clue of what they were playing with. I'm freaking sure that if somebody could have magically told them that thanks to their work, a movie like 'Alien' would have been made in the future, they both would have died of a sudden, shocked by the consequences of their labor, like an honest scientist would if he was shown an evil use of his research. In that sense, but in the best way imaginable, 'Alien' is the atomic bomb.
In my opinion, 'Alien' is the only perfect movie in the history of cinema. Of course, this could be debatable, but of all the films I've watched since I was born, this is the only one in which I haven't been able to find the slightest flaw. It gets a golden ten out of ten. Bright, solid and massive.
I could go on with a panegyric, but I'll try to be short and accurate:
The direction is just perfect. Every shot is marvellous, every movement of the camera is breathtaking. There is absolutely nothing you could add or subtract. Touch it, and you spoil it. Seriously.
The acting is splendid. The performances build a credible world centuries away. I don't know about you, but this take on the future was unveliabably acceptable. Sigourney Weaver is more than a revelation, John Hurt is a master, and the rest are nothing short of marvellous.
The script is a work of art, the story is mesmerizing, well-constructed, well-developed, and free of absurd twists. Its simplicity and efectiveness are yet, 25 years after, to be matched.
The atmosphere is pure genius. Gothic, claustrophobic and sometimes baroque. The use of light and dark is beyond description, the use of sound is as creepy as it gets.
The FX are the best possible for 1979. In the time of the release, some scenes were stomach churning.
The score. Jerry Goldsmith's work matches the images so perfectly it seems to bleed from them. It is and will be the best soundtrack for a sci-fi flick in space ever.
The tagline. ""In space, no one can hear you scream"". THIS is a tagline.
And, of course... the alien. The only alive creature that can steal Weaver the movie. Its design is the most innovative I've seen. It has spawned dozens of disgraceful imitations. This is the real deal. Not only the look, but the complete design of a life form, including biological features. Acid instead of blood. Jaws inside jaws. What more could you possibly want? This is how a movie is done.
A very good sign of a movie that has gone down in history is the amount of collectively well remembered scenes. Well, 'Alien' has so many that I won't go into it. This movie contains so many iconic scenes that has become an icon itself.
So, what else? I urge all young directors to watch this movie a zillion times, as I've already done, and take notes all along. But not in order to rip off from it, as many others have done, but to learn, learn, learn, learn and learn how a movie should be done. 'Casablanca'? You must be joking.
Oh, I almost forget! There's a lovable cat in it.
RATING: 10"
ALIEN,"Alien.....the one that started it all........ Alien....the creature......the film.....the legend. The one that started it all, the one that led to one of the greatest sequels ever made, one that got a comic book mini-series and 2 cross-over films with ""Predator"". This is THE film. And without a doubt, the greatest horror film ever created, and this totally makes ""Halloween"" look like ""Chicken Little"". You can forget about all those rubbish ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies, 'cause ""Alien"" just takes horror up to so many levels! In ""Alien"", we find ourselves in the distant future with a crew just coming back from a haul of 20 million tons of ore back to Earth. But while the crew members are in stasis, their ship picks up an ""SOS"" from a nearby planet, and once the crew is awakened, they are forced by the ""Company"" regulations to follow that signal. And then when they land on the planet and it turns out that something terrifying is in store for them, when a hostile organism attaches itself to one of the crew members. And later on, it becomes clear that the crew member was being impregnated and then dies a horrible, violent death from a deadly breed of an other-worldly life-form. And now the rest of the crew must fight off the creature.
As other classic films should always have, ""Alien"" does great on the characters. And of course, the most recognizable one is the lead woman, Ellen Ripley who is played then-unknown Sigourney Weaver. She provides a very human face and you're gonna feel like you're actually watching a real-life woman in here, and it could be because of her accent, or her mannerisms. But as the film progresses, she develops into a more mentally tougher woman while combating the Alien. There are times when she totally keeps it cool, times when she's afraid, times when she's angry, and times when its just Ripley being Ripley. And thanks to Weavers acting talents, she can really dish out one hell of a character.
The rest of the supporting cast are nothing short of spectacular, Parker and Brett are the selfish, sarcastic men who only want to make a profit. And through most of the film, you can feel the tension that Ripley and Parker have. Lambert, who one of my favorites from here is the second woman who happens to be the opposite of Ripley, a total coward. Dallas, who the viewer might get the vibe that HE is the main character in the 1st 15 minutes or so, is pretty much the leader here. Kane, is the tired, dead-looking guy who is the one that carries the alien species inside of him. And finally, Ash is the one with the sinister purpose and you start to suspect that he's up to no good at some point. And movie characters need to have their own personalities and that's what ""Alien"" has.
And as for the Alien itself, well what can i say? It is the most horrifying creature in the history of cinema, period. I mean, how could you stop it? It has acid for blood, and is very lethal to fight face-to-face. And the special effects were over 20 years ahead of its time. The face-hugger on Kane looked so freaking real, that you're gonna be scared just by looking at it, even it doesn't do anything except breathe most of the time. And the sets couldn't have been better, very futuristic, yet there's always something ominous and dark about them.
The suspense is impossible to resist as the sequences deliver the chills at times when you least expect it, and when you do expect something to happen, nothing happens. And ""Alien"" is one of the very few horror films that understands that you can't scare people by raking up the bodies and the blood, but you have to build up the suspense to do it. And director Ridley Scott is such a genius, and he shows that here, he absolutely knows how to make any kind of film, ones that can scare (Alien), one that can sadden (Thelma and Louise), and one that can excite/thrill (Gladiator). And Ridley really keeps up the dark atmosphere, especially in the beginning when there's no talking for the 1st 5 minutes or so, we get the feeling that something's not right all the time. Some parts are very quiet and very depressing and we feel exactly what we see.
This is the legend that I'm talking about here, folks. Don't miss the chance to see this, because it will scare the living daylights outta you more than any other movie you're gonna see in your life. Take my word for it....I'm practically a movie buff, so I know what I'm talking about...."
ALIEN,"One Bad Apple A classic in sci fi horror movies, this one gets you right from the start. It's a claustrophobic film and never lets up, the trouble is it's been remade so any times and never bettered.
The crew of the Nostromo have just woken up but are nowhere near Earth, instead their ship has received a distress beacon. Except it's more of a warning, and on the planet Kane (John Hurt) is attacked by an alien lifeform. Trying to get back to the ship Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) says the land crew should be put in isolation. Dallas (Tom Skerritt) disagrees and lets them on the ship. BAD IDEA, as one by one the crew is killed, of course there is a bad apple. I won't tell you who but it's pretty obvious as the film progresses. Sequels followed, all starring Weaver and they're all good in their own ways, but this is the superior movie in every way. It certainly helps with a great cast and a superb special effects crew."
ALIEN,"This Ageless, Silent, Haunted House Floating in Silent Space "
ALIEN,"Original and terrifying sci fi terror Alien is Ridley Scott's masterpiece. This kicked off a mostly excellent franchise and influenced cinema as whole. Designed with great detail by brilliant artist HR Geiger the Alien brings forth a new level of intergalactic terror. Alien is completely different from anything that came before and took sci fi horror to new heights and gave it a lot of depth. The ensemble cast is excellent and is lead by Sigorney Weaver and had Yaphett Kotto, Tom Skerrit and Harry Dean Stanton as strong support. In my opinion this film is flawless and still looks incredible today. The special effects are amazing and the acting and direction is spot on. Alien is incredible and in my opinion is timeless. The film aged well and is essential and a classic."
GET OUT,"Just because you're invited, doesn't mean you're welcome. "
GET OUT,"A more than welcome yet uneasy visit Get Out' was very highly recommended by a friend, also a fellow film enthusiast, and the subject matter of the film really interested me. Add to that a very promising trailer, the award nominations and wins and mostly positive word of mouth (even with the very vocal detractors), and interest was higher.
High expectations were not only met but also exceeded. Apologies for the cliché, but to me that is the best way to sum up my personal experience watching 'Get Out'. Can totally see why it was as well received as it was, though can also see why it has divided audiences on here. While it will never be one of my favourite films, 'Get Out' is among the better films of 2017 and does live up to the hype.
It's an incredibly well-made film visually, with stylish and unsettling cinematography and editing and some disturbingly surreal imagery that adds to, and enhances, the unease and sense of dread.
That the direction was done by a first-time director is a shock in itself, one of the most outstanding debut directing jobs seen in a long time by me. It's nostalgic in its embracing of contemporary and classic horror and also brave in the accomplished handling of the film's combative themes.
Being somebody who considers music important when talking about it, the music looms suitably ominously and fits well. 'Get Out' benefits from an extremely smart and clever script (though 'The Shape of Water' and especially 'Lady Bird' were worthier wins for the Best Original Screenplay Oscar in my view), that takes on a lot of elements and balances them adeptly and the individual elements handled very effectively.
Despite how it sounds, 'Get Out' struck me as more of a thriller with horror and comedic elements. It is highly successful on this front, with the thriller elements being taut, suspenseful and unsettling, the comedic ones being darkly funny and clever and the horror ones being imaginatively shocking and subtly uneasy. There is even some social commentary and interracial themes explored, and done thoughtfully and just about avoids preachiness while hitting hard still.
While all the performances are very fine, it is Daniel Kaluuya's superb lead performance that burns in the memory the most.
My only complaint of 'Get Out' is the too pat and somewhat silly ending that felt tacked on and like it came out of a different film, to me it too ended on a tonally jarring and that's it note.
Until then, the film was this close to being a masterpiece. So it was frustrating that it just missed out on that distinction. Nonetheless it's a great film that is among the year's better ones, brought down by an underwhelming ending. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
GET OUT,"Black & White but Far From Monochrome... Satire doesn't get much darker than this, a perspective derived from the opposite of bliss, the frictions and prejudice society draws, to control and manipulate, exploit and ignore.
What would you do, if someone took control of you, could control you're every move, set the tempo to your groove, had the first and final say, how you went about your day, chose the things that you would do, when and where, with what, with who. If you tried to make a stand, put a halt or raise a hand, the mighty structures that surround, would envelop and impound, one for all and all for one, will ensure you'll soon be gone, but be under little doubt, that you're never getting out.
An outstanding piece of cinema and satirical observation with added barbs."
GET OUT,"Creepy, unsettling and very well done. I'll say right off the bat, I didn't really know who Jordan Peele was coming into this movie. I knew he had a show with Keegan-Michael Key and was a comedian of sorts. What I didn't know was that hiding underneath all that was a genuine fan of classic horror just waiting to get out.
Get Out surprised me for a number of reasons. The first is it kept me wondering what exactly was going on. There was just enough there to build atmosphere and tension without giving away the surprise. And it was delivered with such skill and care that It truly unfolded masterfully. You know something is wrong. You know something is up. But you can't quite figure out what it is.
And secondly this was the work of a first time director. It's rare that you get a movie written and directed by the same person on their first attempt and they manage to hit it out of the park.
And lastly, it gave us something new. This is possibly the best aspect because I am sick to death of cookie cutter horror movies. People nowadays have forgotten that horror doesn't just mean blood and guts. Before directors had to create tension and atmosphere by building the plot and unraveling the story slowly. It's refreshing to see this done with such care.
Is it a perfect movie? No it isn't, but it's damn good especially if you're in the mood for a good psychological thriller with horror overtones."
GET OUT,"Simply put this film is outstanding I think it was watching The Last Blair Witch film that I first saw the trailer for this, and while I enjoyed that film, leaving the Cinema it was my memories of Get Out that I left with, I'm so often disappointed by films, having seen wonderful looking trailers, finally a movie that kills of that thinking.
Get out ranks as the Cinematic triumph of the year for me, the film was creepy, poignant, amusing, and I think highlighted the racial problems that still exist, in certain places.
Daniel Kaluuya is an actor, that sadly I've not paid a huge amount of attention too, I kept asking where do I know him from, a friend pointed out that as a fan of Psychoville I should have known. Kaluuya was outstanding, and I'll certainly be taking an active interest in his career from now on, hopefully awards will follow. Catherine Keener never disappoints, she provided the scene of the film for me, the therapy session, providing a moment of sheer terror.
Somehow too dark to be classed as a black comedy, but the satire was definitely apparent. I can't wait to pick up the blu-ray and enjoy it again. I know the ending was changed, I'm assuming with the possibility of a second, I hope they don't, this film deserved to be left alone as a true success.
Brilliant, 10/10"
GET OUT,"Lives up to the hype I decided to see this film at the theater after hearing some of the hype (which was basically that it is an excellent horror film that is told from the perspective of a black man).
Well, I can see this would be truly the worst nightmare of a black man (and really the worst nightmare for us all). This is NOT a film that tries to make the viewer feel ""sorry"" for black people, nor is it at all preachy, but it is just a good old fashioned horror film with a fresh new setting. I'm an old white guy by the way.
The acting is wonderful, and directing is amazing. The film, while mostly horror, is actually completely hilarious in some parts, making it the funniest AND scariest movie I have seen in ages (no easy feat). It is a shame that the film will likely not be regarded in the company of Academy Award potential nominees, because the directing and acting is honestly Oscar worthy. Again, no small feat for a horror movie that is also funny.
In summary, this is a MUST SEE at the theater and one of the best films of the year. It is a fun ride that is very well done!"
GET OUT,"Had Me on the Edge of My Seat This is no perfect movie, but it shouldn't be criticized strictly for racism. The fact is that there exists a group of evil people that have developed a way to use kidnapped victims for scientific purposes. Their motivations are really quite personal and self serving. But unless you are willing to accept that this can be done, then it's no movie. Much science fiction is based on things that are impossible. The bad guys seem to be interested in picking on black people for some reason. But the plot says they do. Peele uses black humor (excuse the term but I mean it in the general sense) and manages to get some of his own experiences to tell a story. I thought it was unique, interesting, and entertaining."
GET OUT,"A rare triple-threat genre film Horror tension, mystery tension and racial tension blend together into a gripping and formidable nail-biter in ""Get Out,"" the astonishing directorial debut of Jordan Peele. The former half of the comedy duo ""Key & Peele"" has found a way to both honor and subvert the thriller and horror genres in a way that's unmistakably modern.
In the tradition of ""The Stepford Wives"" with the twist of ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?,"" the story follows a young black man named Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) who goes to meet his girlfriend, Rose's (Allison Williams) parents at their fancy estate where things go from slightly uncomfortable in terms of Chris being black to deeply messed up in one slow but inevitable fell swoop.
With a creepy opening scene showing a different black man getting abducted in a peaceful-seeming suburb, the tone is set immediately that there's cause for concern. Luckily for Chris, Rose is really sensitive to issues of race and prejudice, and even when her parents (Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener) or brother (Caleb Landry Jones) seem to make Chris' blackness into a thing, the two handle it as best as any interracial couple could. The warning signs come in the form of the Armitage family's black help, maid Georgina (Betty Gabriel) and groundskeeper Walter (Marcus Henderson), whose behavior is anything but normal.
Peele sets a tone of creepiness largely with the help of composer Michael Abels, also making his feature film debut. The unpredictable nature of Georgina and Walter as characters, the ever-increasing suspicion of all the white characters and the way Peele keeps you nervous about who or what is just outside the frame fuel the fear and paranoia as well as if not better than any horror movie featuring more overtly malevolent forces does.
Kaluuya, in a role that will deservedly put him on the map, gives a performance that will connect with viewers who identify with Chris as a man trying to feel comfortable while out of his element experiencing strange things, and those who truly understand Chris' experience as a man of color undergoing the very same events. It would be fascinating to know the different ways a black viewer would experience the film compared to a white one, but the most important thing is that everyone will identify with and feel for Chris.
When a little horror film debut like this one gets talents such as Whitford, Keener and Williams, you know the script is good. Peele keeps up the air of mystery a long time even without packing in very many unexpected twists. The awareness of something being wrong but not quite understanding what it going on or why despite getting new information is a real strength of Peele's writing. Then of course there's the brilliant ways that race and the black experience make it into the film. If that weren't enough, Chris' best friend (LilRel Howry) provides comic relief in a way that's stereotypical, yet Peele uses him in unexpected ways. So we get to benefit from Peele's nose for comedy as well.
Not everything adds up by the end of ""Get Out,"" but the film plays out in extremely satisfying fashion. Fans of horror and fans of thrillers who don't mind horror when it's done well should both enjoy the technique and experience. It provides thrills of the pulse-pounding, thrill-seeking and thought-provoking variety and few genre films can say the same.

GET OUT,fresh take on horror 
GET OUT,"Smart genre mingling effort. As you may guess from the submission date, I'm reviewing ""Get Out"" several months after its cinematic release. Unfortunately, the months of glowing notices have generated an anticipation in me, which no film could possibly have lived up to.
This is not to say that it's not good. Jordan Peele directs well, but it's his writing that is one of the core strengths of the picture. There is such depth to it the screenplay, not only with its allegories and metaphors, but also with subtle foreshadowing and lines with multiple meanings. There are many layers to be ""unpeeled"" (pun intended) on repeat viewings.
The other strength is Daniel Kaluuya. A regular face on UK TV for a while now and with a few smaller roles in Hollywood productions, Kaluuya is brilliant and this should be a career-making performance.
So, what doesn't work as well? Essentially, it's the films third act. I try to write my reviews without spoilers and I will here, but the film takes a leap into science fiction towards the end that stretches your willingness to go along with it. It's an idea that make sense figuratively but not literally. Also, Chris transitions a little too far into action hero territory, given that there's been nothing to justify that, save some talk about Judo lessons.
Provided you're not anticipating horror in the traditional sense, ""Get Out"" is a smart genre mingling effort. Not perfect, but certainly not bad for a debut film."
GET OUT,"director Peele takes you on a different kind of journey A unique and effective blend of horror film and social commentary if there ever was one! Young black photographer Chris Washington is understandably nervous about going to spend the weekend with the parents of his sweet white girlfriend Rose Armitage-who for reasons unbeknownst to him has yet to tell her parents that he's black. They set out on their trip and...well the rest is really left for the viewer to discover. Writer-director Jordan Peele shows master craftsmanship by taking this simple premise and expanding it in many different directions, incorporating elements of racism, comedy, shock and awe, and wisely never taking things too seriously. The climax is a bit formulaic and over-the-top, but the journey is effectively unnerving and features much stronger acting than you would expect for a film of this genre. Not for everyone, but refreshingly unconventional and worth the viewing experience. ***"
GET OUT,"I want your eye, man. I want those things you see through. Jordan Peele wrote and directed this psychological thriller where he earned an Academy Award for original screenplay. Peele was blessed with an excellent cast like Catherine Keener and Bradford Whitford as Rose's parents. The other cast members were just as excellent in the their performances. Peele slowly introduces the audience into an interracial city couple. They go to the suburbs to visit Rose's parents. They all seem so happy to meet her African American boyfriend. It just seems too good to be true. Their employees, an African American housekeeper named Georgina and Walter who worked the grounds are just strange and off to Chris. The next day at the strangest party, we meet very eager middle aged caucasians and a very strange silent bingo game. Peele carefully reveals the secrets to the audience layer by layer. There is not that much gore and violence until the end. Peele was masterful at building the suspense, intrigue and dilemma. There were a few minor questions about the motives behind the secret. I don't want to spoil the plot. The film slowly builds to thrilling conclusion and that's what makes it a great thriller. Peele was careful about slowly building that with every scene and sentence. You just couldn't help yourself once you first start watching it. I enjoyed the performances from Whitford, Keener and Stephen Root as well. The actor who played the leading role deserved his nomination for best actor in the film."
GET OUT,"My Kind Of Horror Thriller After sitting through two and a third long hours of ""IT"" recently, being bored mostly by the predictable CGI and the usual jolts in today's so called horror films, I just watched ""Get Out"". I wasn't expecting much, as the DVD had 5 mediocre to awful previews. But almost immediately, I became intensely involved by the plot and quality of this film, which mixes social satire and racial issues brilliantly. This is not like most horror films today, but rather more like suspense thrillers as ""The Stepford Wives"", ""the Harvest"", or ""The Tall Man"". The scares are not like jolts, but rather stem from the nervous feeling that kept me glued to the screen, anxious to see what will happen next. I just learned this was the director's first film, though it seemed to have excellent production values and built suspense seamlessly. I love stories where something strange is going on, and the mystery is gradually revealed, like the original ""Invasion Of The Body Snatchers"" or ""Night Of The Living Dead"". For those not looking for gore or shocks, but rather suspense, this should satisfy most of you. But if special effects are your preference, maybe stay away."
GET OUT,"Thriller seen from fresh eyes Fantastic! I would not call it ""horror"" but certainly ""thriller"" with some comedy thrown into it. This Jordan Peele fellow has managed to bring something new to this genre and I certainly hope he'll do more thrillers.
The cast is great and I especially enjoyed Betty Gabriels performance. Lots of faces I have never seen before and they all did a stellar job. And those faces I have seen before did a stellar job, too. =)
I do not know if the overall idea is new but the way it was presented and the way it was done feels very fresh.
Warmly recommended!"
GET OUT,"600th Review: As Lingering and Effective As You Would Want It To Be Get Out is full of touches and surprises, strong acting, excellent direction, and above it, it's a ride, a trip to a place Hollywood doesn't normally go - it offers a unique experience - and in this age of copycat, cookie cutter safe choice cinema, it stands out by a mile.
Get Out is that rare beast - a film that leaves you satisfied yet pondering. We objected to its constant referral as a horror film - it's an effective thriller with mild horror elements - but it is not a gore/slasher movie - this is more about getting under the skin, and inside the mind, of the viewer.
The plot is simple: girlfriend takes boyfriend home. Home is not what home seems to be. Fun ensues. The genius of this is the way it plays on both white and black perceptions - we asked how the film would be if you reversed all the roles (pretty darn effective) etc;
Get out and see it."
GET OUT,A Novel Approach For A Thriller 
GET OUT,Guess Who's Coming to Dinner 2000 
GET OUT,"Get Out is a Sleeper Hit for a Reason, it's Creepy, Inventive and Topical "
GET OUT,"Flat, predictable thriller with glaringly obvious plot twists Get Out' is a disappointing and highly overrated movie that fails to meet even the most basic expectations of a horror/thriller. It lacks any real scares, is generally ineffective in its attempts to be creepy, and many of the would-be thrills fall flat due to the fact that the plot is, for the most part, completely predictable with many of the plot 'twists' glaringly obvious.
To most viewers, it will be fairly obvious what is going to happen in this movie from very early on, and so the big 'twists' really don't have any impact at all. I was sat there waiting for something that I hadn't seen coming - a smart and well-disguised twist that all decent thrillers have, but it never arrived.
Even to the very last scene, 'Get Out' is so predictable and never even attempts to think out of the box, resulting in a rather dull, boring and forgettable thriller."
GET OUT,"An intelligent, sophisticated, Neo-Blaxploitation, horror chiller "
GET OUT,"Now you're in the sunken place! Not all the directional debut sees this kind of welcome from the audience. Yeah, Jordan Peele had written and directed it. It is similar to the 90s style mystery-thrillers. Definitely must see for the 90s, 80s guys. It kind of looked like a black comedy, but I guess that's not they had preferred. Especially that teacup scenes and some of the close up shots, that freaks, yet very funny.
Well, this is the story of an interracial romance. When Chris decides to meet his girlfriend's white family, living outskirt of her hometown, all goes as planned. But he was not sure how her parents take it, that he's a black. Now everything has settled, but his visit started to take a strange turn after a series of weird events. What it is and how he overcomes it is the remaining tale.
The casting was amazing. The story was suspenseful. You would feel you can predict the scenes, but not that easy and when twist happens, you will realise it was simple as that. This is a hit film now, but if it was 20 years ago, surely would have gotten a cult classic status. And yes it is, thinking the future.
When this got out and its pre release, I thought it would disappear without any trace. It is rare a recognition a film like this to get to having a second string cast, debutante director and being a low cost film. I got entertained thoroughly as it delivered as promised. But I think some people are overjoyed and praising it like crazy. That's true if you are not a film fanatic, otherwise it is one of those decent films. Surely not to be missed. One of the best of this year.
7/10"
GET OUT,"Finely tuned racial themed psychological thriller This film manages to encapsulate quite a few themes. We have here a psychological thriller/horror which has themes on race and standing.
The film begins with our lead (a young black man) who is to visit the white family of his well to do girlfriend. As you are to find out, not all is at it seems.
I don't wish to say too much more on the story as it will easily give too much away. The film can be quite derivative, and as you watch it, there are various films you can clearly see which influenced it.
However, that doesn't take away from the gist of what is here. There are racial themes that will make you ponder on it all way after you've watched it, which is what this is all about. It make it interesting, but it doesn't shove any political agendas down your throat.
The acting is great, with some recognisable cult film actors present. Special mention must go to LilRel Howery who provides some comedy and tension relief in an otherwise very dark but often darkly humorous movie.
I enjoyed it despite the uncomfortable nature of it. Worth a try, and a good entry in the horror genre for this year."
GET OUT,I Don't Get The Hype 
GET OUT,"This is an excellent movie This movie is pure gold. It has nice twists, works on deeper levels, has some fascinating premises, is acted well, is original. Really, really nice job.
It is always nice to see movie with some twists, and also those that give you some food for thought. But sometimes the twists are for the twist sake. This is not the case here. Everything makes sense, and in more than one level. The atmosphere of underlying racism is done in a way that makes people from across the world, who did not have contact with USA slavery issues, get good insight. But the movie is so much more than this, and will surprise you, make you think and leave you intellectually and emotionally satisfied. So few movies can do this as competently and decently as this one. This is one smart movie."
GET OUT,"Creepy, thoughtful and often hilarious The warning comes early on in Get Out, comedian Jordan Peele's deliciously unsettling horror and directorial debut. As successful New York photographer Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) phones his best friend Rod (a hilarious LilRel Howery) to break the news that he is to meet his white girlfriend's middle-class parents at their countryside home, Rod immediately voices his concerns. He is adamant that there is bound to be some weird, sex-slave s**t going down, but Chris laughs it off with no idea with what is in store for him. In years to come, I have no doubt that Get Out will be a key case study in trying to understand the racial minefield that is modern America. While many have convinced themselves that such medieval attitudes are now behind them, it's quite clear that tensions are as high as ever in the #BackLivesMatter, post-Obama world we live in.
On their journey, Chris and his girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams) hit a deer. When being questioned by the police, the white officer can't resist giving Chris a hard time, even though he wasn't the one driving. He receives a telling-off from Rose, but the tone is set. Chris shrugs it off because he is no doubt used to it. Upon arriving at the impressive home of the potentially future in-laws, father and neurosurgeon Dean (Bradley Whitford) insists they are 'huggers', and appears to embrace Chris. He nonetheless lets slip opinions about wiping out the race of pesky deer who roam their land and voices his frustration at his own father missing out on the Olympic Games due to Jesse Owens, but again this is nothing Chris hasn't seen before from middle-class, white Obama-voters. Rose's mother Missy (Catherine Keener) is more steely, but is a trained hypnotist and offers to help Chris rid himself of his nicotine addiction. So far, so uncomfortable, but things soon get seriously weird.
For such apparently racially-blind liberals, their household staff are all black. Not only that, but they are like dead-eyed robots, all smiles and pleasantries masking pleading and inner turmoil. When Chris tries to bond with groundskeeper and fellow brother Walter (Marcus Henderson), the conversation is awkward and stiff, and maid Georgina (the brilliant Betty Gabriel) seems to do little during her off- hours but stare at herself in the mirror. At a gathering at their home, the only black face in the large crowd seems unnervingly familiar, but he is dressed up like a trophy pet by his fat, much older white wife. When Missy finally gets Chris to sit down for a session and open up about the death of his mother, his worst fears are truly realised. Taking inspiration from, of all films, Being John Malkovich (which also starred Keener), Peele directs these moments with the eye of a horror maestro, proving to be truly uncomfortable, claustrophobic viewing.
Get Out wears its heart on its sleeve, with an almost complete disregard for subtlety. However, this works in the film's favour. It's hugely entertaining and frequently very funny, so it will appeal to just about any audience, reaching more people in the process. Word-of-mouth has already gotten around, so the message is clearly resonating. It's sharp and unique in a way that modern horror movies rarely are, and in no way feels like an elongated sketch from the Key and Peele TV show. Although I've seen relatively little of his work outside of sketches on YouTube and his appearance with Keegan- Michael Key in season 1 of Fargo, there is nothing in his previous output to suggest he was capable of crafting such an intelligent and engaging horror movie. Satirically savvy and edgy, Get Out is also creepy and thoughtful, proving that a black man alone in the white suburbs is just as terrifying as a pretty white girl lost in the woods."
DRIVE,False Marketing 
DRIVE,"A Captivating Mix Of Contemporary And Retro Aesthetics Drive' is a visceral and brilliantly executed vision of art-house action; possibly one of the greatest art-house films to have graced the screen. Nicolas Winding Refn has created a stylised neo-noir thriller that is simply stunning; full of glorified violence and stroking imagery. The soundtrack is amazing, fully reflecting the films mood, whilst attempting to create an atmospheric feel to accompany the gritty action. 'Drive' is a captivating mix of contemporary and retro aesthetics. A stylish and taut thriller that keeps the audience entertained from start to finish with breathtaking sequences, brutal violence and stunning cinematography, a modern masterpiece that has truly redefined the noir genre."
DRIVE,"A Driver without a Name In Los Angeles, a mysterious driver (Ryan Gosling) is a man of few words that works as a garage mechanic for his only friend Shannon (Bryan Cranston); stuntman in Hollywood films; and driver of getaway car in heists.
One day, he helps his neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan), whose husband is in prison, and her son Benicio (Kaden Leos) and her falls in love with her. However, a few days later her husband Standard Gabriel (Oscar Isaac) is released from prison and they meet each other in the building. Standard is pressed by the criminal Cook (James Biberi) to rob a pawn shop to pay for the protection he had in prison, and the driver decides to help him driving the getaway car. However, the heist does not work as planned, Standard is murdered and the driver discovers that they have been double-crossed by Cook. Further, the money belongs to the Mafia and now he has to protect Irene and Benicio from the mobsters.
""Drive"" is a good thriller with the lead character without a name, recalling the style of Clint Eastwood in ""High Plains Drifter"" in the role of ""The Stranger"" – a man that speaks a few words only, violent when necessary that protects innocent and beloved people. The film is weirdly attractive with potential of cult movie.
The stylish cinematography discloses in an adequate pace the big picture and develops characters very well. The conclusion has an open end, a characteristic that has been forgotten by Hollywood. My vote is eight.
Title (Brazil): ""Drive"""

DRIVE,"Intelligent Adrenaline After a summer of cheap thrills, Drive delivers thrills on the cheap. With a budget Michael Bay might have allocated for a single effects sequence in Transformers 3, Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn made one of the best movies of the year. Following Bronson and Valhalla Rising, Refn crafts his most polished, commercial work yet, while retaining all the ambiguity and unbridled aggression of his tough-as-nails art house pictures.
Bearing thematic resemblance to Darren Aronofsky's recent output, Drive is like Black Swan in overdrive. The film pins its headlights on the dark implications of unchecked obsession and good intentions gone haywire. That dangerous duality – humanity on the razor's edge of animal brutality – is played to unnerving perfection by Ryan Gosling.
Rightly among the most reliable names on the Hollywood marquee, the star of Drive plays a crucible of a character. A friendly, fatherly figure to his neighbor (Carey Mulligan) and her young son, he's decidedly less so when the two are threatened. A sort of oblique, ultraviolent superhero, the driver leaps to defend the innocent with bloody determination. If the first half of Drive plays as drama, the second is straight up revenge fare.
Playing on the juxtaposition of calm and calamity, Refn keeps us on our toes throughout. Quiet moments stretch into suffocating silence, and the explosive violence that inevitably shatters it practically tears the frame in half. The audio is expertly mixed; you'll want to see Drive loud. From its roaring engines and visceral blows to its curt dialogue, the film is an altar to the power of great sound design.
In truth, Drive isn't pervasively violent, though its most excruciatingly effective moments leave a memory trail like tire streaks on a sunbaked highway. At the heart of the story is a compelling, surprisingly tender romance. Carey Mulligan has proved herself a similarly reliable talent to Gosling, and has worked in recent years with the likes of Michael Mann, Oliver Stone, and Mark Romanek.
Her fragile character's relationship with the driver is subtle and nuanced in a manner atypical of thriller convention. They're not family, they're not even sleeping together. Drive is not a sexy film. Refn fetishizes neither cars nor women; if The Fast and the Furious is the sleek exterior curves of an automobile, Drive is the greasy, undulating pistons. And it's utilitarian at a lean 100 minutes.
The rest of the small cast also impresses. Albert Brooks plays against type as a cutthroat crime lord, and a note-perfect Ron Perlman plays his meathead partner. Bryan Cranston of TV's Breaking Bad has a small role too, as employer and confidant to Gosling's character. Their relationships shuffle as lines are drawn and redrawn, but none of them comes away unscathed by the film's end.
Drive is either the explosive end to a lukewarm summer movie season or an early autumn adrenaline rush. In machismo, it far outpaces its hundred million dollar competition, leaving overwrought tales of lesser heroes like Thor and Green Lantern in the dust. Its troubled characters, and the bonds of desperation that link them, elevate the film above its genre trappings and shield it from disposable entertainment status.
Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive is an anomaly. It's like a 1200 horsepower hybrid. And it's one of the best movies of 2011."
DRIVE,"Different, Intense, Brutal, And Simple Drive is different, intense, brutal and simple, Drive is not like any other thief action film with a loud music, lot of gunshot, jump from here to there, it's not, Drive is a face pacing movie that will keep you interested every single second of it, fills with incredible performance by all the cast especially Ryan Gosling, Drive is a great time."
DRIVE,"Fate? Unknown... Drive is directed by Nicolas Winding Refn and adapted to screenplay by Hossein Amini from the novel of the same name written by James Sallis. It stars Ryan Gosling, Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Albert Brooks, Oscar Isaac, Christina Hendricks and Ron Perlman. Music is by Cliff Martinez and cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel.
Driver (Gosling) has a day job, he's a Hollywood stunt man, but by night he makes the serious cash as a getaway driver for the criminal fraternity. Into his life comes married next door neighbour Irene (Mulligan) and her little boy Benicio (Kaden Leos), pitching him right into the middle of two wars; one is for his emotional worth, the other with the criminal underworld.
Real human being, and a real hero.
They cheered at Cannes, it has garnered instant cult classic status as well as gushing critical praise, Drive is arguably the biggest surprise of 2011. Some would debate that it arrived in a year that was dominated by blockbuster brain drains and pretentious parables, meaning it wouldn't take much for something like Drive to find a favourable audience. Yet Drive is a special movie, the surprise being that it delivers a different film to what the plot synopsis suggests. There would have been many disappointed that it didn't turn out to be something akin to The Fast & The Furious 19, but as its reputation grows, one likes to think that many also had their senses tingled unexpectedly by Refn's western done out in 1980s neo noir attire.
Yes, at first glance it looks like a simple story given over to style over substance leanings, where the fact that our laconic protagonist is not prone to dialogue expansion, could lend argumentative weight to those potential dissenters only skimming the surface of the picture. But the material is in excellent hands, with Refn, Sigel, Gosling and co, calmly unravelling Amini's stripped down screenplay to reveal a gritty urban fable that's laced with ethereal overtones. A picture where a look means more than any words can express, a subtle holding of hands reveals many layers peeling, and then the serene state of play often gets punctured by bouts of shocking violence, yet always it remains a picture big on intelligence, beating a mighty heart in the process.
Propelling the picture forward is the complexity of Gosling's driver character. He has no back story for us to work from, and he gives nothing away outside of the tender bond formed with Irene and child. He is actually one of many purposeful grey areas (or should that be gris areas?) within the plot structure. We learn just enough to be on his side, a noble but flawed hero battling against fate as he fights for the innocent, he be Shane for a modern pot boiling Los Angeles. Helps, too, that he's so cool behind the wheel, where he mines Steve McQueen's effortless charisma. Refn delivers magic moments of car play, from the near ten minute opening getaway extended sequence, to a high speed kill or be killed pursuit, when the action flows it really pumps the adrenalin.
Gosling is amazing, instantly iconic, soft voice matching his soft blue eyes, toothpick perched between teeth, it's a testament to his acting ability that the requisite homages to iconic characters of movies past never veers into parody territory. It's with the calm moments that he triumphs most, be it watching TV with the boy Benicio or just gazing intensely into Irene's eyes, Gosling has a magnetic quality of some significance. Mulligan, too, is wonderful, deftly underplaying Irene to work off of Gosling to create heart aching tenderness, their chemistry superb. Isaac does fine work with the ex-con/husband character that is thankfully not stereotypical, Brooks is Colm Meaney like, thriving on simmering badness, while Cranston puts real heart into the role of Driver's garage boss, the closest thing the Driver has to a pal. The only one dimensional character lands in Perlman's court, but Perlman is such an ebullient and watchable life force the film survives the character's oafness.
From the opening pink neon credits, accompanied by the synth plink of a retro 80s soundtrack (a soundtrack so memorable it lands in the ears and stays there for days), it's evident that Refn is a man who takes his style serious. Drive is full of classy (yes arty) passages, fluid camera movements, single takes, non central framing of characters, slow motion unfurls and eye dazzling chopper shots of a neon lighted L.A., the director has an eye for the quality required to cloak his story. He of course is aided considerably by his editor Matthew Newman, and Sigel's photography. The former is dealing in seamless precision, the latter a master of shades (a lift sequence is to, ahem, die for) and colour toning delights. Marking this out as a Blu-ray essential.
You can name about ten films that Drive has been either likened too or put forward as an influence, and Refn's work here has been touted as an offspring created by Michael Mann, Walter Hill, William Friedkin and Sergio Leone (all viable and all actually high praise indeed). But rest assured, Drive is still fresh and exciting, the perfect movie package. Refn's masterpiece and one of the best films of 2011. 10/10"
DRIVE,"A contender for my favourite of the year so far? Yes, very likely. Of a very hit-and-miss year so far, I have seen some gems like Tree of Life, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy(the first two in a way are not for everybody though), Rio and Source Code. And then I saw Drive, which was simply brilliant.
Like I said with some of my favourites this year, Drive is not a movie for all. It is a slow-paced movie, but I did not find it ""boring""(a term I hate with a passion, as it is massively overused and hardly ever elaborated upon). For me, just because it is slow-paced, doesn't necessarily mean it is going to be a bad movie, only when other components don't work does it apply to me, which is not the case with Drive.
Besides, Drive isn't even the only slow-paced movie around, so I don't know why people have to make such a big deal of it. There are many other movies(Godfather, 2001, Tree of Life, Brokeback Mountain) that are and deliberately so. I feel also that Drive is paced deliberately, for atmosphere.
The pauses and the ""sparse"" dialogue to me were just two of many things that made Drive so great. There is such an atmosphere here, one that is very tense and beautiful at the same time. The pauses actually helped to enhance this.
Refn does a fine job directing. From his previous work, this director showed promise, and here he delivers all the stops and gives his best directorial job so far here.
The story starts off electrifyingly, and then slows down again without ever feeling dull, thanks to the unrelenting violence, that is part of the world that is shown here through the eyes of the title character, and adeptly edited car/chase sequences. The dialogue I also have no problem with, it is memorable without falling into cliché territory. The characters are credible, especially the titular character, whose characterisation is perhaps the most complex of the year.
The cinematography is truly excellent, as is the editing, bringing much to the atmosphere and I'd also go as far to say that Drive could very well be the year's most visually stylish film. The colours and scenery are lush on the eyes too. The score is every bit as electrifying as the start of the movie, and manages to raise my adrenaline.
Acting-wise I couldn't fault Drive either. Carey Mulligan and Christina Hendricks's roles mayn't be as well written as Gosling's or Brooks', but these two actresses-particularly Mulligan- manage to bring some much needed credibility to them, elevating the characters to a higher level, and Ron Perlman, Oscar Isaac, Bryan Cranston and in particular Albert Brooks are terrific. Ryan Gosling is simply mesmerising, in his best performance to date. It is a quiet, yet very charismatic and intensely brooding portrayal, reminiscent of Robert DeNiro in Taxi Driver for characterisation and Alan Ladd in Shane in how the role is conveyed.
Last but not least, the elevator scene. Brutal, yet very powerful and moving, I'd say it is a contender for the best scene of 2011. In conclusion, a brilliant film that for fans of films from the 70s and 80s and were expecting a sort of nostalgic throwback in style will appreciate. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
DRIVE,Reminder on why we love movies 
DRIVE,"An art-house action flick at it's finest I think we all remember hearing about Ryan Gosling right after 'The Notebook' came out. Most men, including myself, neglected the man on his acting ability. It's not a good reason to not really appreciate an actor. But when it comes to romantic flicks like that, i'm not really keen on the subject, or it's actors for that matter. But film by film, this man is starting to impress the hell out of me. Now it's about time to see what kind of chops this man has when it comes to an action film.
Believe me when i say this.......it is the coolest damn action flick i've seen in quiet some time. It's not your basic shoot em' picture. It has this slight 'noire' edge to it that makes it shine much brighter than the rest.
For starters, let's talk about the pace of the film. Most may call it slow, whereas i call it hypnotic. The lead played by Gosling, is a cold and quiet fellow who barely even speaks, blinks, or give any reference to his emotions. The film is littered with these somewhat awkward pauses by his character........i personally wouldn't call them awkward, because the way the film is presented, it makes them look beautiful. Case in point......in the movie ""Heat"", you know how Dinero, Kilmer, Sizemore, Trejo barely speak to one another. But the overall feeling is just so entertaining to watch? That's the exact same feeling you get when you watch this picture.
But as the film rolls on, Gosling's character becomes a bit more vibrant. And by that, i mean more gory. It's not the kind of gore you would expect. Not like Tarantino gore, but more like a David Cronenberg gore. (History of Violence, Eastern Promises). You know, the settle, yet explosive gore that you really weren't expecting......which i love. And then the movie does nothing but climb higher and higher with it's level of intensity. It took this stone cold character, and molded him into one cool ass superhero.
But what really sold me on this film was it's overall FEEL. The best example i can give is this........it's a cool mix between ""Heat"" and ""Taxi Driver"", with a very artistic edge. I already said that the movie is hypnotic, and i cannot stress that enough. Once the picture starts, your eyes are literally glued to the screen. The cinematography is fantastic, the musical score is hip and awesome, and the acting is top notch. All these elements were executed to perfection.
Bottom Line.......i may go and see this movie again. I rarely ever do that......THAT'S how awesome this was. It's an art-house action flick at it's finest. Both men and women will drool over this movie. If you get the chance, go and see this movie......you will never regret it."
DRIVE,Amazingly violent....so beware. 
DRIVE,"Great use of Subtlety It would be difficult to write about parts of the storyline in this film, because many expectations change when the consequences of one event folds upon another. A terrific original screenplay defies Hollywood conventions of over-the-top plot convolutions and unrealistic twists. Sure, there are a couple coincidences, but there are many rewards for keeping the story simplified and enhance the characters' arcs. The director borrows heavily from Michael Mann in painting a cool atmosphere with glistening city lights at night and a throbbing synthesiser soundtrack. The film elevates itself above any other similar film in it's drama, perhaps better than the character rich film ""The Town"" from 2010. The editing emphasises the main character's withdrawn persona, hiding his emotions (indirectly hinting at his criminal past) while romancing his neighbour. Moments in conversation where a 'normal' person would express their feelings or be more extroverted, are instead tension filled passages of silence that speak louder than words. With great use of subtlety, the film does wonders in terms of depicting the main character's withdrawn mental state, but still visualising his thoughts and intentions without direct exposition.
Another accolade must be given to actor Ryan Gosling in the lead role. We the audience must invest time into this character, which the film keeps in the first person narrative, most activities outside of his knowledge are outside of ours. He must show realistic reactions to danger, even though his past is never quite explained. The right emphasis is given to revealing moments of his capabilities, so when he is set in harm's way, we believe he can stand up to the test. The rest of the cast is well heeled in talent, allowing the sense of naturalism to provide the tone. As you may notice in critical reviews, when a film exposes no obvious weaknesses, the positive rating goes up. I myself am having a hard time exposing any weakness in this film, I felt I was in good hands, and was not annoyed by any plot contrivances. I happen to be a fan of Michael Mann, as must the director of this film, and the right homage elements work for me. I think of this perhaps of the antithesis of ""Fast & Furious"". One of the best films I have seen this year, could even get an Oscar nod with the screenplay or editing."
DRIVE,"Simply wonderful Nicolas Winding Refn's previous film, VALHALLA RISING, an existential Viking epic with Mads Mikkelsen, was a breath of fresh air for this tired reviewer. I immediately marked out Refn as somebody to watch, and while his prison biopic BRONSON was a little disappointing, I waited with interest to see what his next movie would be. Well, DRIVE was it, and the good news is that it's his best one yet.
The story is simplistic, as is always the case with Refn: the hero is a getaway driver by night and a stunt driver by day. Through no fault of his own he gets caught up in a scam involving some deeply unpleasant gangsters, and it all kicks off from there. Refn's gameplan is to contrast moments of serene beauty and tranquility with shots of unflinching and bruising violence and it works a treat; this is one of the best and most memorable movies I've seen in a good while.
Everything about this movie is great: the moving soundtrack, the exquisite camera-work, the subtle yet profound performances. Ryan Gosling is a new to me star, but his acting works a treat; he's as iconic as Eastwood back in the day. I don't even like Carey Mulligan but even I have to admit she's on good film, too, as are the various old timers (Ron Perlman, Albert Brooks, and Bryan Cranston).
The first half of DRIVE leads you to wondering where it's all going to go, but in the second half it all slots together nicely and becomes more predictable. That's not to say the predictability is a negative though; Refn knows exactly how to handle his thematic elements, leading to confrontations that pay off beautifully. This is a superb film throughout and one I can't wait to see again."
DRIVE,Most overrated movie of 2011 
DRIVE,"Fantastic retro action with art-house flair! It seems to be the case nowadays that film audiences, particularly at this time of year as the summer winds down, are left with a choice of seeing the latest broad appeal movies filling the multiplexes, or venturing to the local independent cinema in search of more intellectual fare. Very rarely will a film transcend these boundaries and offer a mix of Hollywood-style action and art-house flair, which is what makes Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive so unique and something to be celebrated.
Drive tells the story of an unnamed stunt driver (Ryan Gosling) moonlighting as a getaway driver for a crime syndicate run by Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks). Seemingly a loner, the driver becomes involved in the life of his neighbour Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her young son Benicio (Kaden Leos). After agreeing to drive for Irene's newly paroled husband Standard (Oscar Isaac), and finding himself on the wrong side of assassination contract, the driver embarks on a mission to protect Irene from the vicious gangsters who would seek to harm her to get at him. It's a well-worn plot line which in the hands of someone less adept than Refn would likely be nothing more than a forgettable thriller, yet the massively talented director, who picked up the Best Director prize at Cannes this year for Drive, crafts an engaging and thrilling throwback film elevated by masterful performances across the board.
Refn, previously known for the fantastic Bronson, and the lesser known but equally excellent Pusher trilogy, is a man who has very clearly studied his Kubrick. Certainly most modern directors could do worse than imitate the style of one of history's greats like Stanley Kubrick, but rarely does one pull it off with the skill of Refn. In Bronson, the influence was a little more obvious, with the resulting film seeming like something of a spiritual successor to A Clockwork Orange. With Drive however, the traces are a little more subtle, visible in the impeccable technical touches, and the use of dissolves, pensive long takes, and slow zooms, a hallmark of Kubrick's catalogue. Drive is a flawlessly crafted film, filled with beautiful imagery of the Los Angeles underworld seen more often in the work of Michael Mann.
The technical achievements of Drive are more than matched by the acting of the entire cast, and Refn shrewdly selects a wide variety of performers to populate the story. Top notch support comes from Bryan Cranston, Christina Hendricks, the ever dependable Ron Perlman, and particularly Brooks, who jettisons his familiar comedic persona in a truly frightening and villainous performance, which will surely be on the radar of voters come awards season. Mulligan shows characteristic heart in a largely overlooked role, yet the film unquestionably belongs to Gosling. Often heralded as one of the finest actors of his generation, in Drive Gosling delivers his best work yet as the driver; a quiet role that is all the more effective due to the subtlety of the performance. He displays an ability to ratchet up the tension using just the slightest widening of his eyes and tensing of his jawline, and when the character is pushed to act more forcefully, Gosling transitions from almost silent observer to brutal aggressor so swiftly that it leaves one breathless. It's work that he makes look easy, yet it's the most focused performance seen in an action film in quite some time.
There's something undeniably retro about Drive, with its neon opening titles and 80s infused soundtrack, but the film seems remarkably fresh. Smart action filmmaking is so hard to come by these days, so Drive delivers refreshing variety, beginning the time of year when the so-called prestige pictures are released with a bang.

DRIVE,"No. Just, no. "
DRIVE,"The Very Definition Of ""Dreadful"" Seriously - there are times when I just don't get this site. I get that people have different tastes in movies - but this movie has a ridiculously high rating. To be perfectly blunt about it - it's dreadful. If you look up the word ""dreadful"" in the dictionary, I'm sure that there will be some reference to ""Drive"" in the definition. It takes almost half the movie before we really get a sense of where this is going - and even then it doesn't become very interesting. It's ridiculously and often graphically bloody and makes terrible use of bad music to try to build suspense.
Ryan Gosling is the star of this. He plays a Hollywood stunt driver who also moonlights as a driver for more than a few shady characters. But that really doesn't matter, because ultimately his ""undercover work"" isn't what gets him in trouble. He gets in trouble because he falls for his neighbour - who happens to be married to a guy who gets out of prison owing a lot of money, and he decides to help him out, gets entangled in - something. I tried - hard - to follow along but I spent a lot more of my time just trying to stay awake.
One thing I have discovered over the years is that people get caught up in the hype about a movie, and when it turns out to be dreadful, they can't admit that they got caught up in the hype, so rather than calling it a good movie, it becomes an ""artistic masterpiece"" or some such thing. But seriously - let's cut to the chase. This was dreadful. Just dreadful. (1/10)"
DRIVE,"A Tense and Often Beautiful Masterpiece. You might hear one comparing this to a Tarantino film, but leave all worries at the door, this is an absorbing and tremendously unique piece of cinema from Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn. The reason it works so exquisitely well is because the film grabs hold of you and takes you inside this often dark and dream-like LA setting. So, when the end of the film hits, you feel apart of this film, and it's there to stay.
This film also offers a Ryan Gosling like you've never seen him, speaking only when necessary, with tension and fury in his eyes. He's silent, caring, and ridiculously tough. Every line is delivered perfectly and every gesture is natural.
I saw this at the LA Film Festival on a mammoth screen with booming speakers. The music only makes this film more unique. It is catchy and synchronized perfectly with the TRULY beautiful cinematography.
This film is the BEST of its genre. I honestly cannot compare it to any other film, for it is truly that different. ""Drive"" is already the best of the year, because I'm POSITIVE no other film will haunt and invade me quite like this film has. This is not just a classic for its genre, but a beautiful and bold classic in general."
DRIVE,"Best Film of 2011: ""Drive"" At the Theater- ""Drive"" -- This is not an Action film, this is not a ""Car"" movie- It's a character-driven, slow-burn thriller of the first order that features elements of some of the finer works from Directorial royalty like Martin Scorsese, Michael Mann, William Friedkin, Quentin Tarantino, Walter Hill and the late Sam Peckinpah.
The film is an electric mixture of beautiful, lingering cinematography, a pulsating soundtrack, lean dialogue and short bursts of graphic, bloody violence. It's tense and involving- almost impossible not to get immersed in. Nicolas Winding Refn is a Director to definitely keep a tab on.
Ryan Gosling is the embodiment of some kind of cold fire at the heart of the matter- his ""Driver"" character is a well-intentioned but unstoppable force that will surely end up as a cult favorite for decades to come. Carey Mulligan, Albert Brooks, Ron Perlman, Bryan Cranston, Christina Hendricks and Oscar Issac round out an excellent cast that's pretty much in support but extremely well-utilized.
Those wanting to check out a quick and disposable, mindlessly fun popcorn flick need to steer clear- this isn't what you're looking for. This is deadly-serious film-making that's damned-near perfect.
It's my favorite film of the year- Hell, it's one of my all-time top faves.

DRIVE,A stylish and violent neo-noir thriller 
DRIVE,"NWR's best film, one of my all time favorites When I started to get interested into film, I somehow started watching movie reviews on YouTube, and my favorite YouTube movie critic was and still is, Chris Stuckmann. After binge watching many of his videos, I found out that one of his favorite films is Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive. I decided to watch it one day, and I was very mixed on it at first. I then watched Chris Stuckmann's Analyzed video on Drive, but after that, I still didn't understand the movie too much. Then, one day, I just had the urge to watch it again. I don't know why, I just did, but watching it the 2nd time was a very mesmerizing experience. The soundtrack, the cinematography, the acting, and it's complex story makes Drive one of my favorite films of all time. Many people did not like this movie upon its release, and I think it is because of its misleading marketing. The trailers for Drive make it seems like the movie is a straight up action film with the utterly handsome Ryan Gosling in the leading role. The movie is actually a meticulously crafted neo-noir film that doesn't concentrate on the action, but on its complex story. This film is not only one of my favorite arthouse films, but one of my all time favorites."
DRIVE,"Empty, soulless and sadistic with a pseudo-artistic touch! I believe that the most important element in a movie first is ""having heart and soul in the delivery"" in other words dramatic structure which leads to impressiveness and effectiveness both. Why the worst film I have ever seen in my life is Federico Fellini's Otto e Mezzo? or Why I hated Darren Aranofsky's The Fountain? Because there were no heart and soul in the delivery and believe me especially critics love that! Cinema without heart. Now, let's talk about Drive. What an original and ""never-seen-before"" story! A hired driver who doesn't talk much decides to protect a family, a girl and her child and things in his job go awry! Other than such clichés in the plot and lacking of heart and soul, there were other flaws in the movie. Being a ""driver"" or being a cool hired killer is not that easy! Ryan Gosling's wooden performance and his senseless character are just pointless and has not any interesting or deep element. The violence in the movie was neither artistic nor entertaining, it was sick and sadistic! Also it was pointless! You know Quentin Tarantino makes extremely violent movies like Kill Bill, but it is entertaining and it is artistic at the same time. Drive is not! What about music? Well, oddly, it reminded me Tron, another movie I didn't like, so simply I wasn't impressed by the songs either. Is Drive an action packed? Not at all! The movie has an exciting opening, but then it turns into an empty and dull pseudo-art work with some disgusting violence. The rest of the movie is not a piece of art or an audiovisual feast in contrast with the hype, that's why I was seriously frustrated by the movie! Unfortunately the flaws hasn't finished yet, Drive has an anti climax and pretentious finale that leaves you totally unsatisfied. I am sorry, but the ones who call this as art owe other art house directors an apology."
DRIVE,"Drive through LA A haunting movie with a stilted atmosphere reminiscent of Mulholland Drive though in an altogether different genre. The pink credits beginning the movie and the music throughout are pure eighties and set an offbeat tone against the contemporary LA streets and skyline. Great character studies punctuated by violent action scenes keep the audience immersed in this blood bath of a movie. Some powerful performances, stylish direction and intricate plotting complete this strangely understated production. Drive may not deliver box office gold in the short term though will certainly be paying long term dividends as a reference point for future film noir writers, directors and fans."
DRIVE,"Overblown simplistic writer's fantasy So this was the movie to watch these days. An asocial hero hiding a heart of gold and ultra-violence under apparent dumbness. He is not even slightly interesting, he doesn't talk, he lives in his little inner world of cars and precision mechanics, an economy-class emotional bubble that can burst into something relentless.
Ah yes they brought to life the superhero next door, the kind of monster living only in the brains of writers. Bad writers that is. Writers that will happily confuse nothingness with rich inner substance. You want a specific car stunt for $500? Just ask the superhero driver. He needs no careful planning, it's all in his veins. Have some trouble with the local Mafia? Head-on collision is the solution, the silent boy can certainly write off a couple of big mouths and settle it all. Seems some director found the story compelling and convenient though. And viewers bought that sh*, which is most disheartening given the level of gore graphic and gratuitous ultra-violence.
The nihilistic trend sells well as artsy gutsy stuff these days. The Coen bros dood it, and it's now a real consummate genre from Cronenberg's self-inflicted History of Violence to There Will Be Blood. Adding the F-word in movies was an artistic endeavour years ago, now it seems that violence, especially dumb violence, is the way to show off how much more gripping you can do with less substance."
DRIVE,"A Multi-Layered Abuse to the Film Industry So I walked out of the movie Drive. This is the first time I've ever done such a thing. I've seen a lot of bad movies in my day but there has never been one that infuriated me to a point in which I couldn't continue. And being a film lover, I sat down and analyzed just why exactly this movie ticked me off so much. What was it about this movie that drove me up the wall to a point in which I walked out before I even got to see the conclusion? It wasn't the acting. It wasn't the music. And it wasn't the lush cinematography. What irked me the most was that Drive was disguising itself as an indie flick when in actuality it wanted to become an action movie so badly.
And this strategy while an insult to the entire institution of filmmaking, worked. It got rave reviews at film festivals here and there and got nice reviews from critics, lavishing the acting, supposed tension, and cinematography. I watch this movie because of the rave reviews and literally saw the Transporter movie wrapped in an indie flavor, nothing more. The first half, where we supposedly see ""character development,"" consists of characters engaging in extremely minimal small talk and the rest of the time just staring at each other. I am not kidding. After the tense opening which reveals our main character's secret job (which is familiar to the opening of Transporter), we get nothing for about 40 minutes. Except a lot of pointless scenes.
Drive is about a very good stuntman that doubles as a secret driver at night (Ryan Gosling) who silently falls for his new neighbor (Carey Mulligan) while at the same time gets mixed up in a mob scene (which loosely is a Transporter plot). The first half has all the development, only in the second half is when we see all the action and driving you've been observing in the previews. Based off a novel of the same name, the script must have been easy to write, because it barely has any dialogue while the story is pretty much a mashup of Tarantino-like violence with Transporter-like symptoms.
The movie is so inconsistent, and amongst the small pieces that don't fit together they are all sparkles of what we've seen before—and what we've seen before has all been superior. The supposed amazing chase sequences? Bourne and Ronin does them better----and to a similar budget extent, The Transporter. The supposed amazing violent tension? I can name dozens of movies that do it better. And the extreme violence that is inconsistent with the theme, tone, pace, and characterization of the first half of this slum? Of course, while it doesn't quite match the plot it's been perfected years upon years ago by Tarantino and even to an extent Robert Rodriguez.
But another big reason why I dislike this film so much is because with Drive, we've seen it all before, and yet the critics will not point this out—or choose to avoid it. We've seen these types of movies before (quiet men that has their actions do all the talking), we've seen this type of ultra-action before, and we've seen these stupid attempts at conflicting and blending genres far too many times in the indie and mainstream scene. Drive was originally billed as blockbuster during development so what do they do? Hide the fact that it's the clichéd low-caliber blockbuster that's trying so hard to be a European Tarantino hybrid. They trimmed the dialogue, screen time, and for the Cannes Film Festival nixed the action billing and called it an independent film. They literally were changing the packaging and tone of the movie based off of box office numbers. That's disgusting. They were trying to sway the critics by changing the entire genre.
Bottom Line: Drive, you are a pathetic, pointless, stupid, trite, slow, muggy, grudgy, tasteless, senseless, disposable, forgettable movie with abysmal pacing, abysmal writing, and no sense of direction whatsoever from the first second to the last second I watched before deciding to walk away. You don't know what movie you want to become, as you literally spit yourself through at least three different genres that actually repeal each other like a magnet. You barely clock in at 100 minutes, yet it felt like two hours the first half in. I will not blame the acting, for they had next to nothing to work with. I will not blame the cinematography, which wasn't bad either. I will blame the fact that your crew decided to pretend like your movie was artsy, underground, and indie, when in actuality your movie is this ultraviolent action movie that rears its ugly head long after the audience has fallen asleep through the numbing first half.
Your movie sucks.
Bad."
OBLIVION,"Oblivion is, personally, one of my favourite modern sci-fi films. "
OBLIVION,"""I am Jack Harper and I am Home"" For decades it has been an accepted fact of life in Hollywood that, no matter how good the movie, endings are a write-off.
Hollywood has learned the hard way that, no matter how good the film (or the book on which it is based) it is impossible to do an ending which satisfies the writer, the director, the producers, the critics, the audience and (duh!) reviewers like this one.
That is why, for literally as long as there have been movies, endings are changed at the last minute; and often even multiple endings are shot so that survey groups can be brought in to make the final choice.
The reason I gave this brief lecture on the importance of endings is simple -- going into the last 20 minutes, this was a rock solid film with a rock solid script and rock solid performances.
But the ending was ... perfect.
And perfect endings are so rare these days that I needed to write a review for posterity that does nothing except note this for future readers and future viewers.
Are we still an effective team???????????"
OBLIVION,"much better than expected ! The trivia tells us that this is based on a comic book that director joseph kosinski wrote in 2005 but was never published. The story takes place in 2077, just after the ""memory wipe"" that jack (cruise) describes for us. And the invasion by space travelers, which destroyed most of the cities and made living on the surface mostly impossible. Some great special effets. The control panels, the copter, even the wrecked surface of the planet. Jack is tasked with protecting the structures that support the floating living quarters for the remaining population. I LOVE the mini moto that jack rides around on... kind of like a george jetson briefcase that folds and unfolds. Google it. Some beautiful scenery of iceland, and various film locs in the united states. When another human from the past crash lands, we're not sure what her mission is, or who's side she is on. Some really good suspense, while we wait for answers. Especially when morgan freeman is involved. Really good sci-fi stuff!"
OBLIVION,"Don't know why this movie didn't make it I have now watched this movie 3 times, and each time have liked it more than I did the first time, and even then I still enjoyed it a lot. I look at the litany of trash on the screen that DOES make a profit and am dismayed that this one was so unsuccessful. First, it's a GORGEOUS movie, and it definitely has a beating heart. I found the acting quite good, the story involving, and was quite moved more than once. And the technical staff was amazing! I suspect that it will do well on home video and cable and that one day we'll look back on it and wonder why in the world it did so poorly in its initial run. I applaud director Kosinsky and his fine team of actors and the legion of other professionals involved in bringing this to the screen. I REALLY enjoyed this movie!
31Jan14: Months later and I've watched it at least once more from my Blu-ray plus find it almost impossible to NOT watch it when I stumble across it on HBO, and I continue to find it absorbing and I STILL can't watch the end of it without crying! I find it embarrassing to write this, but I think I love this movie."
OBLIVION,"If you like Sci Fi, you'll love this! I hadn't really heard of Oblivion before I watched it, but I'm a big fan of Tom Cruise and his films, as he is such an excellent actor. Right from the start, the film doesn't disappoint. It has a real depth that a lot of action/Sci Fi films don't have. A beautiful ambient soundtrack is matched perfectly to the pace of the film and in it's own right is a work of excellence that I now listen to on my iPod.
The characters are believable, and as expected, Tom Cruise plays his character really well. Morgan Freeman also plays an excellent role here, and I feel was perfectly cast for his role.
The special effects are very good. The creators went to great efforts with many of the sets and props, constructing full size ships, and massive screens to project backgrounds, rather than just use blue screen and CGI, which I feel responsible for ruining many modern films. (The Star Wars prequels comes to mind!) Where CGI is used, it's not over the top, and blends well with the live action and real sets. The tower set is a work of pure beauty, and helps add to the bright and wide open feel of the film, if that makes sense.
As I said previously, the soundtrack is fantastic, and allows me to watch the film over and over without getting bored of it. The sound effects are excellent as well. Specifically the drones make excellent noises at various stages of the film.
The overall plot is very good. It has a good amount of twists, and real depth. It is all played out at a pace that seems to adapt perfectly to the story. Action sequences are fast, and deeper, more emotional sequences get the slower pace they deserve.
It's funny, but it's one of those films that maybe didn't win any awards and maybe didn't break box office records.. but I find myself watching it again and again as it's just so watchable and enjoyable. There very few films I own that I can watch, go back to the beginning, and watch again right away. Black Hawk Down is one of them, and now so is Oblivion. In fact I only watched it last week, but after writing this review, I'm tempted to watch it again tonight.
I hope you enjoy it as much as I did, and continue to do so!"
OBLIVION,"A memorable sci-fi fantasy world with a human heart at its core. If there is a soul, it is made from the love we share.
There are many ways to describe Oblivion, but the softly spoken afterword by Tom Cruise's character really makes you feel the human heartbeat of this sci-fi epic.
As always, the trailer is full of explosions and set pieces. Oblivion the movie is an entirely different beast that values a human story and characters that are driven by common purpose. While the cast is tiny, I found much to enjoy from Cruise, Riseborough, Freeman and that Nordic guy from Headhunters who is showing up more frequently in Hollywood blockbusters. Aside from unusually limited screen-time, Morgan and other supporting cast are effective and memorable.
The threads of the plot are well-woven and I won't give anything away, so what I will tell you is to prepare for a powerful journey into the unknown where nothing is what it seems. Explosive set pieces take a backseat for sci-fi philosophy with twists to spare.
Oblivion ticks all the boxes for correct use of literary devices and establishes enough original cannon to stick in your mind long after the credits start rolling. It is a distinct success among the largely abysmal offerings of 2013 so far, don't miss it."
OBLIVION,"Oblivion - A look back. Oblivion is nine years old as I write this, and in perusing the reviews written when it opened, they have aged far less well than the movie.
Those reviews are mostly concerned about whatever the hell Tom Cruise was going through at the time, or obsessed with obscure symbolism in the production design.
For whatever reason, it appears the reviewers couldn't get over themselves enough to just watch the movie and evaluate it on its merits.
On the off chance this film has escaped your attention, it is well worth two hours of your time. It is solidly acted and produced, has first class effects, and a spectacular location. The story combines some emotional heft with a clever and satisfying twist at the end.
I watched it again, but this time with my SciFi hating wife. She protested initially, watched the entire thing, and then thanked me for getting her to watch it afterwards.
That's as good as it gets."
OBLIVION,"As entertainment, brilliant.... I went to see this having read a few reviews, I also heard a review from a friend that Richard Wilkins on Australian critic had said it wasn't that good.
Well, I have no idea what film they saw, but it wasn't the one I saw. The start was a little slow, but still threw in some moments of concern to keep one on the edge. As the film settled on, it kept moving at a good pace. Story was a basic love story, mixed in with morality, but basically, love story.
Cgi was amazing, cinematography was brilliant, stunning even. All the main characters were easy on the eye too, always making it easier to want to watch.
Plot wasn't sophisticated, probably described as feel good, but frankly, it was perfect. I left a 2 hour film and wasn't bored for a second.
Cruise, for all the press on him and his supposed kookiness, I don't care, he carried the film.....
GO SEE THIS, pure entertainment."
OBLIVION,"naysayers are right, but I still liked it Reading through the previous reviews, I find myself agreeing with the negative reviews in one sense, but still disagreeing overall. I walked away quite liking this movie.
Most of the complaints are around technical/realism stupidities, or else being a rip-off of previous movies.
Re stupidities: there are plenty, most of the negative reviews are correct, but they miss the point, which is given a more or less silly premise, do the characters fulfill their struggle properly.
For me the answer is strong yes, I tend to respond to the emotions a movie is trying to convey, ultimately this is a story of loss and love, a nice universal theme that always resonates.
Given that theme, the movie's style, effects, music all worked really well to reinforce that. I liked all the performances.
Be careful about critiquing modern SF movies about technical stupidities too much. Most of these have a fatal flaw that would destroy most of them. How about the likelihood of star travel? OK, you have to grant that otherwise most SF movies pretty much fall flat.
But still, the basic premise is not realistic: a star faring race, searching for energy, is not going to bother going to earth for its water, that is so much more easily available anywhere else, energy itself is much more easily accessible without playing with water for fusion, just stay with your own star, mine your own asteroid belt or gas giants.
Sure, it makes no sense for the Tet to make and use human clones, but given that, do we have a good story? I think so.
To me, valid criticisms are when characters, immersed in their realities such as they are, do not act true to their nature. And thus a movie like Prometheus failed since there the highly trained biology experts acted like complete morons.
But that is not the case here. In this movie we have passion, loss, and love, the struggle to persevere.
Plus the drones looked really really cool.
Re copying other movies: get over it. This movie is distinct enough to feel its own. I saw and loved Moon (which granted is the better movie), but I enjoyed this one for what it was.
I think it helped for me to not see any trailers, and to come in with low expectations after hearing about bad reviews."
OBLIVION,"Oblivion movie review- beautiful, stylish, fantastic "
OBLIVION,Solid sci-fi where things aren't what they seem 
OBLIVION,"Amazing visuals, OK film "
OBLIVION,"Excellent Sci Fi movie - do NOT read spoilers! I SO enjoyed this movie - always LOVE to see a very entertaining sci-fi film. This one really must be seen on a big screen. But don't let anyone tell you about the movie plot (which is excellent)!!! If they start to do so, stick your fingers in your ears and hum! Don't be tempted to read spoilers!
Part of your fullest enjoyment of this film would come from everything about it being a surprise. If you like sci-fi, you will thoroughly enjoy the plot line, the action, the actors, wonderful visuals of earth, the music and the well-done special effects.
Just watch the trailer if you need to be intrigued. It is a well done representation."
OBLIVION,"GREAT FOR THE SCIENCE FICTION FAN! And maybe everyone! They don't make many science fiction films these days. This was a pleasant surprise all throughout the film. Man did I like this film.
And in my opinion. Tom Cruise really likes what he does, and works at his craft as an actor very seriously. In my opinion 95% of Cruises movies in the last 10 years have been good choices. And I'm sick of what the media says about his personal life.
I am one who went and saw Prometheus with an open mind. And listened to what the director said about it NOT being an Aliens movie. And LOVED IT. Good Sci-fi. Such as this film.
It definitely turned out to be something I wasn't expecting.
Excellent Job by Everyone involved. Nice work Cruise!"
OBLIVION,"A beautiful movie you won't regret seeing Brilliant writing; great performance by the actors; beautiful and realistic scenery; wit that makes us laugh, and a story we passionately follow with a proper ending that make us think about what does matter in life.
What more can one want from a movie? 9 out of 10 for what may be one of the best movies ever made in this genre."
OBLIVION,"Visually excellent though slightly too long This movie is - without a doubt - one of the most visually spectacular that I have ever seen, standing shoulder-to-shoulder in that department with the likes of Watchmen, Prometheus, Sunshine and Kosinski's preceding effort - TRON: Legacy. Also (like TRON) the soundtrack is excellent and very well used throughout, enhancing the action and adding depth to some - at times - distinctly average acting performances.
Tom Cruise plays Tom Cruise but that's not a bad thing in this case, in fact his natural charisma carries the movie through some of its slower sections. Morgan Freeman plays Morgan Freeman though he's really not on screen for long enough to influence the movie one way or another. Olga Kurylenko's statuesque profile is unfortunately not matched by her acting ability and I often found it difficult to believe in her character's actions and emotions. Andrea Riseborough turns in maybe the best performance, convincing as the sad and confused Victoria, unwilling - or perhaps unable - to confront the disturbing truth.
At over 2 hours I think that it's too long by about 20 minutes. A shorter cut would tighten up the story and eliminate some of the slower sections which I think hurt the movie's overall rhythm and flow.
Overall, I would definitely recommend going to see this movie in the cinema, on the biggest screen that you can find. It just won't be the same on TV. The visual appeal alone is reason enough, but combined with a clever (if not entirely original) script, a thumping soundtrack and some exciting action, you should be entertained."
OBLIVION,"Invasion, Recollections and Truth In 2077, the human Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) works with his companion Victoria ""Vic"" (Andrea Riseborough) on the surveillance station Tech 49. Jack repairs drones and his memory was erased as part of the security process to stay on Earth, and he knows that Earth is completely depleted after sixty years of war against the alien invaders Scavengers ""Scavs"". The aliens have destroyed the moon and were defeated by nuclear weapons and the earthlings have moved to Jupiter's moon Titan since the planet was completely destroyed. Now Jack has to protect the power stations that use the ocean to supply energy to Titan fixing the drones. He also has recollections of a mysterious woman at the Empire State Building when Earth was habitable. Jack and Vic receive instructions from Sally (Melissa Leo), who is located on the space station Tet, and Vic is anxious to leave Earth in two weeks to join the survivors on Titan. However, Jack has a cabin in a secret place where he likes to stay alone.
When the spacecraft Odyssey crashes on Earth, Jack witnesses the drones killing the human crew but he rescues a woman, Julia (Olga Kurylenko), who is the woman of his recollections. Julia and Jack recover the flight recorder but they are captured by the Scavengers. Soon they learn that the Scavs are actually a group of humans led by Malcolm Beech (Morgan Freeman) that tells to Jack that the invasion was a lie. Jack does not believe and Malcolm releases Julia and Jack and asks them to go to the radiation zone to find the truth.
""Oblivion"" is a great sci-fi movie, with an engaging and entertaining story of alien invasion, recollections from the past and the truth. I am not fan of Tom Cruise, but he has a perfect performance in the role of a man that discovers the truth of the alien invasion. The plot is very well constructed, with intelligent plot points, one of them inspired in ""Lunar"", and the special effects complement the story as should be. My vote is eight.
Title (Brazil): ""Oblivion"""
OBLIVION,"Really enjoyable, interesting and at many times beautiful (score, scenery and a great heart ) sci fi "
OBLIVION,"A unexpectedly really good movie. Without revealing any spoilers, I saw this movie ""out of the blue"". Never saw a trailer (I still haven't). I remember hearing the name of the movie and completely forgot about it, and just decided to take a chance and watch it on cable TV one night. It is a Sci-Fi movie with a human heart, so you don't need to be a science fiction fan to enjoy it. Also, I am not a Tom Cruise addict, but he does a great job in his usual way. In fact, all the actors portray their characters very well.
There is mystery, action, a little bit of love, and some adventure. The beginning is good, there is a high point, and the ending of the movie is satisfactory in my opinion. The special effects are executed in a way not to take away from the story or the plot, and the story does not revolve around them, but rather they are just a part of the story. If you are looking for a good movie to watch, I have to say it is well worth the viewing, not too predictable. Sit back and relax, you'll enjoy this gem."

OBLIVION,"Spoiler-free review, the less you know the better you'll enjoy it I really wanted to see this movie from the first time I saw the movie trailer a long time ago. I came up with all sorts of fun endings in my own mind based on the trailer and eventually my curiosity caused me to read too much and I read some spoilers that I wish I hadn't. I still enjoyed the film immensely, but wish I hadn't read the spoilers and suggest you shy away from all potential spoilers, reading as little as possible before seeing the movie. So when you're done with this review, don't read anymore, just go see the movie.
I had the good fortune of watching this movie at an advance screening on a smaller IMAX screen and I really enjoyed it, as did the huge audience, judging by the lively and jovial banter as people exited. The movie follows Jack Harper who is a drone repair tech in a future earth that has been ravaged by an alien invasion. He has a by-the-books eye-in-the-sky (literally) assistant named Victoria (nicknamed Vika) who watches out for Jack and reports to Central. They live together in a sky platform to avoid the alien scavs who come out at night. Jack is keeping the drones repaired to defend huge energy machines from being attacked by the scavs. Once enough energy has been stored up from the world's oceans by the energy machines, the remaining survivors of earth hope to leave in a few short weeks for the safety of a new base on Saturn's Titan. To protect certain things, Jack and Victoria's memories have been erased before their present situation. Jack is confused about why they have to leave earth, whereas Vika is ready to go, but they both cherish and respect each other. Then Jack meets Malcolm Beech who tells Jack that things are not exactly how they seem, which sets off a series of events that eventually lead to the end of the movie.
Some critics have mentioned something like ""we've seen these ideas before"" in other movies. While it's true that there's nothing totally new in this movie per se, that doesn't make the movie less appealing, IMO. Thinking back to when I was much younger and saw the trailer for the movie Independence Day in the theatre, I remember thinking that the movie looked really fun despite the fact that there've been a zillion alien invasion movies before, but I still hoped they'd do a great job with it because the trailer for the movie was awesome. Was there anything earth-shatteringly new about the movie? Not really, but it was still excellent entertainment. That's how I feel about Oblivion. To me, it's great entertainment.
The only minor complaints I had was that the volume of the music while Jack and Vika were in the pool was too much and sometimes things dragged ever so slightly between action sequences. Overall though, this movie was definitely a remarkable treat."
OBLIVION,"An Orgasmic Audio-Visual Fair! Here's a fine example of a film that may have an inconsistent and a familiar screenplay, but still makes up for an exciting watch due to its director Joseph Kosinski's extra-ordinary sense of creating spectacles that feel like breathing artworks. The effective background music makes them feel even grander. I think Kosinski's creative process starts basically from the music. It's essentially an orgasmic audio-visual fair, just like Kosinski's previous and debut film- Tron:Legacy. He's more ambitious here, and more passionate. Although, you can't help but recognize the influences behind the story-which are some sci-fi epics I won't name here-and feel deja-vu; it still never stops being exciting and interesting. Oh, BTW I suggest to listen to Oblivion OST by M83 (amazing shoegaze/electronica band) before going for the film. Really! M83's soundtrack feels like Hans Zimmer-Daft Punk-M83 all together at once. And that's effing awesome!
I wait for the day when Kosinski is handed an ambitious and promising screenplay. That day, I believe, he will make a master-piece worth savoring for lifetime."
OBLIVION,"I enjoyed it I recommend Oblivion. The special effects alone make it worth seeing. Unless you choose to watch this film with a chip on your shoulder. Or if you think every homage is merely a rip-off of another film.
There are many references to other sci-fi classics, which I found enjoyable. But I did not dwell on them during my viewing, because I was engaged in the story and the visuals.
I also liked the cast, though, in some ways, they were playing second fiddle to the visuals. The sound and music were also enjoyable (the Led Zep sequence was magical).
This film is best seen on a big screen with theater sound."
OBLIVION,"Excellent Sci Fi. Don't listen to the negative reviews! I just finished watching Oblivion, and once again, the ratings and reviews were mostly unhelpful. This seems to be a growing trend here. Movies have actually been getting better in the last half decade and yet audiences are getting more cynical. Oblivion is so much better than the 7/10 it's currently rated at on IMDb. Yes, there are some familiar ideas contained within the plot, but it definitely stands on its own, and the film is a visual masterpiece that keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. Oblivion is better than all the modern Star Wars movies put together. I don't know what it takes to satisfy people, because I don't know how anyone can walk away from this film without feeling thoroughly entertained."
OBLIVION,"A Nutshell Review: Oblivion Written by Joseph Kosinski, KArl Gajdusek and Michael Arndt, and directed by the Kasinski, who was also responsible for bringing a new spin to the Tron legacy, Kasinski traded the dark settings of that film for the light and bright, minimalist and futuristic look at Earth some 60 years after 2017, where unknown alien forces had taken out Earth's moon, and plunging the planet into chaos with its unpredictable forces of mother nature ravaging it, followed by an invasion that took out most of the human population. The war was won, but at the expense of the planet since the nuclear fallout made it uninhabitable. So the survivors made that interplanetary migration to Saturn's moon Titan, leaving behind a skeletal crew of two - Jack (Tom Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) - some drones, and a forward base controller (Melissa Leo) to harness energy from the oceans. And of course to mop up what's left of the alien race still down on earth.
However, that's what we're lulled to believe, as we follow the typical day of Jack and Victoria, who wake up, get to work, with Jack essentially being a human Wall.E, repairing broken down drones, and patrolling their assigned territory from the skies. Jack and Victoria enjoy life as per any typical couple with not much for recreation at night, but there's something niggling in Jack's mind, being haunted by memories of a strange, beautiful female (Olga Kurylenko), something that shouldn't happen given their mind wipe, and whose unannounced, surprising presence threatens to upset their entire couple harmony, and their effectiveness as a team. Three's a crowd and making things worse is when jealousy enters the picture.
To say any more would be to ruin the many surprises in store, which lead to the many revelations that when pieced together will make perfect sense, since the writers kept the cards close to their chests, revealing crucial plot points at intervals, which is frustrating yet satisfying, and well worth the wait, although sometimes at the expense of pace, or editing continuity that wasn't as smooth as it would have liked to be. But no matter. Granted that the expositions won't be anything new, with genre clichés abound that the fans amongst us would be able to predict, but it's how these elements come together so perfect that makes Oblivion such a worthwhile watch. Yes there are the sleekly designed vehicles befitting a sci-fi flick here, with the necessary attention to detail and explanation to make everything seem plausible for this apocalyptic vision of the future.
But I love the emotional core that anchored the film a hell lot more, so much so that I dare say not a lot of films, and a science fiction one at that, managed to move. It deals with the longing of a normal life, which Jack had desired as he slips off the radar now and then to build that illusion of an idyllic life in a pocket of paradise he found, with reason of course to come later in the narrative. And the love triangle was well played out, where its beginnings couldn't come any simpler than a brush, a touch and a photograph, all very fleeting, to sucker punch it through to your heart. And just how all these humanity blends so well with the CG- ed technology on display, that made it unbelievably solid.
Tom Cruise is a very different animal here altogether, without his usual toothy grin, and being a lot more serious, sombre and contemplative with his character, that worked wonders. No doubt the obvious hero in the film, many elements of heroism got played down to make it a simple fight for the survival of a loved one, without grandeur plans of needing to save the day at the forefront. Olga Kurylenko may be the flower vase here, but what an effective one playing opposite Cruise for the first time, with her sheer presence making it believable the extent a man would go out for her. Andrea Riseborough, being the relative rookie amongst the three, also stood her own, playing what would be a tragic character seeing her blissful future snatched from under her feet. Her subtleness in her final scene in the film, spoke volumes of her ability to say so much with so little.
A couple of scenes that stood out for me, such as the black and white flashback scene involving Jack and Julia (Kurylenko) when they meet before going up the Empire State Building, communications between Victoria and Jack when their perfect teaming started to give way, together with just above every revelation that had Jack flabbergasted, and those sweeping cinematography of landscapes of a broken Earth. And what provided this film that extra dimension, is the excellent and hauntingly beautiful score by M83 that lifts this film into another emotional stratosphere altogether, that without which, the movie isn't likely going to be as memorable, or emotional, as it got made out to be.
Watch Oblivion on the IMAX screen no less, for those awesome visuals to envelope right up to the peripherals of your vision, and for that crystal clear pounding of the soundscapes and soundtrack right into your aural senses. This is the modern day treatment of The Wachowski's The Matrix in a certain way without the philosophical babble, but my, I'd give it five stars and a perfect ten! A definite recommendation, and a firm entry into my shortlist as one of the best films this year so far!"
PREY,"If it bleeds... Confession: I'm the guy who watched the original Predator way too many times thanks to the magic of VHS...but then never watched a single sequel afterwards. As far as I'm concerned ""Predator"" = jungles and body butter. So I fully admit that I have limited context here. That said, this movie kicked butt. I cared way more about Naru and her brother (not to mention her dog) than I did about anybody in the original. I found the cinematagrophy breathtaking, I found the characters compelling, and I'm kind of all in on seeing what happens when we transport modern franchises into different historical/cultural contexts. Plus, the callbacks were delightful. Nobody's going to give this movie an Oscar, but I'd rather watch a story like this than most movies with capes and poorly staged action sequences. I was sucked in from moment one, and Amber Midthunder completely captivated me for the whole runtime. It's nice to know that movies like this can still surprise me, not to mention make me stand up and cheer."
PREY,Review Of 'Prey' 
PREY,"Prey is a back to basics return to form with tremendous atmosphere and suspense that unfortunately won't be experienced in theater. As a lifelong fan of this franchise I am admittedly biased. Since the revolutionary classic first film, Fox/hollywood have made 4 sequels all of which I have thoroughly enjoyed/ still critiqued. A perfect sequel hasn't been made imo and may never be, but I can say this new film has the closest effective wilderness ambience/suspense to the first film and that warrants great praise.
I was skeptical with a few things judging by the trailer but seeing the final product I can say that no matter the logic holes in the mismatch of Pred vs prey , the film is executed quite well. The settings are phenomenal and amplify the overall product. Dan Trachtenberg has a keen eye for detail as seen in 10 cloverfield lane and shows it once again. The costume design captures a completely different timeframe awesomely as well as shows a new more prehistoric predator that might be the coolest visually yet. Music and sound is crisp and powerful and adds so much. The acting is bare bones but for the story it has to be as far as context.
It's a shame that this had to be only streaming as it should have been in theater. The scenery is fantastic. But regardless it's a surprising return to roots as far as the back to basics setting and suspense aspects. It's another welcome sequel and should be seen by any predator fan or action fan."
PREY,"Could Have Been Great Had They Kept It Realistic There are a lot of reviews here defending this film, calling it the ""Second best Predator film!"" in the franchise, and throwing around a lot of buzzwords for anyone who doesn't like the film. There are also an incalculable amount of individuals defending the main character, Naru, saying she relied on her wits and tactics to win fights, and that's what makes her believable. That's only partially true.
See, Naru literally has the strength of three men (if you watch the film you'll know what I mean). Can survive physical traumas no other character in the Predator franchise was able to survive, and can move as fast as a small sedan. She does use some tactics, but most of all her feats are of the physical variety, and literally in the realm of being a super human the likes of which would make Captain America jealous.
Without spoiling anything, it's simply that Naru survives things she shouldn't survive, and can do things multiple times outside her weight class to the point where the suspension of disbelief is not only shattered but grounded into dust and scattered among the four corners of the wind. For everyone who defends Naru as a character, just ask them some simple questions: how did she recover so quickly? How did she manage to out-power men? And why was she able to survive things nothing else in the film could survive?
The responses will be a smattering of equivocation and justifications that don't hold up under scrutiny, and that's where this film's biggest problem comes in: it doesn't hold up under scrutiny.
Another big problem is that no one seems to be properly afraid of the Predator, even during an era where superstitions were mightily high. Naru shows no fear of anything, even in many life-threatening situations, which seems completely opposite of someone her age. I'm sure someone will justify why, but I would instead point out that this just pulls you out of the film as being nonsensical and unrealistic. Why does this teenage girl have a deathwish and fears nothing? Constantly trying to engage in situations where things are purposely trying to kill her?
A good counterbalance to Naru is the daughter from Shawn Linden's film Hunter Hunter. I didn't like the second half of that film but the first half was brilliant. Why? Because it was grounded, realistic, and intriguing. Also, it was completely believable that the daughter was that good a hunter; we saw how she trained with her father, in a realistic manner. We saw that even with all her training since a small child, she was still prone to mistakes, and how the fight/flight/freeze mechanism came into play when her wits and abilities were put to the test. That's how you pull the audience in and keep them rooting for the character; when they're grounded in realism.
The problem here is that Prey is rife with anachronisms from the modern era. How Naru behaves, how she talks back to everyone, and even how she's depicted in never being afraid of anything (although, to that end, almost no one in the film seems to properly show a realistic kind of fear given their circumstances).
The anachronisms combined with the super-human abilities just takes away from the film, and that's a real shame because if this film was grounded in realism, it actually WOULD be the second best Predator film. Why? Because it's filmed quite well; Trachtenberg knows his way around a lens, and he makes Canada actually look like a pristine northern forest from 18th century North America. Lots of fantastic wide-angle shots and great color composition help give the film a nice, authentic look. Sound design is absolutely on-point, and the score isn't over-done or too nostalgic.
Unfortunately, the film is plagued by too many problems. They should have committed to having the Comanche speaking Comanche throughout the film (as this would have brought the film to another level of quality and authenticity, much like Mel Gibson's Apocalyptico), they should not have had modern-day behaviors that seem mirrored after social media expectations of characterizations, and they should have given Naru realistic feats appropriate for her age, height, and weight, as that would have done wonders.
For me, I was willing to give this film a shot, but the more I watched, and the more I thought about it after watching, the lower the score became. It's essentially a good film marred by its own undoing. A lead character who is depicted as always being right (even the film manages to retroactively throw that in as it progresses), and having her depicted as having super-human abilities, while outmatched and out-manned, just took me completely out of the film. Also in the original Predator, Arnold's character Dutch did ZERO damage to the Predator in their hand-to-hand fight, and Dutch was at the brink of death in just a few hits from his over-sized foe. And none of Dutch's traps worked against the Predator save for a contingency trap that he used after another trap failed. Keep that in mind when watching the final showdown in Prey."
PREY,"Lack of realistic characterisation Excellent production value, and it is very well made, can't save this film from falling into the all-too-common trap of having the central character without flaws, being able to achieve superhuman feats and general unrealistic portrayals that diminishes the films believability.
If a character achieves some incredible physical feat or overcomes a situation that they have no realistic way of achieving then the film loses all it's danger against the protagonist. If they can survive that, they will survive anything.
Immediately a film audience should be immediately emotionally disconnected Hollywood is essentially so focused on gender and identity politics that theyve forgotten to make their characters real people.
If theyre so determined to have strong female characters then look to women like Ripley. Here's a person who overcame the odds because she had no choice. She suffered great trauma and had to deal with it's after effects which is shown within the film. She has to overcome her own personal demons and fears in order to even begin to tackle greater problems. Necessity is the mother of Invention. Ripley was a survivor and she did what she had to do to save those she loved. She was not a flawless exuberant talented Mary Sue like Rey from Star Wars and the girl from this film and practically every other production these days. These people are caricatures.
Here as in many other films today, particularly in regards to female characters they are presented without any personal weaknesses or hurdles to overcome. Worse still, they present all men as weak, disposable, unlikable, something to be despised and of course they must be the enemy as well. How is this promoting equality or Unity? How is this inclusion? This just creates more division which is obviously occurring. You can simply scroll through the reviews here and in practically every other film or series that Hollywood makes today and see what's happening. They are personally responsible for generating reams of hate. This won't end well.
Ironically this film was written and directed by two white men. My suspicion is that films do not get the budgets or even greenlit unless they tick these, what's becoming stereotypical, gender identity boxes.
No film can be successful without good characters. Even story is second to a realistic person that people can identify with. Including and especially, all their shortcomings struggles. It's one of the very basics of scriptwriting. Hollywood seems to forgotten that.
They are actually providing a very poor example to young girls who think what they see on the screen is true. That they can beat up guys and tackle any situation and overcome without having to learn any skill or work around problems that arise. They can literally just do anything they want in these films.
And what sort of example does it set to young boys. They are worthless? That they are evil and useless? No one seems to be wanting to add them into the inclusion mix today. Males don't matter. Especially white males.
This is really a terrible era that we're in and Hollywood is responsible for a lot of it. That and social media where a lot of this started. Self-interested groups got together and made a lot of noise making it seem like they were much more powerful than they really were. The media jumped on board and Hollywood followed. Soon companies and government jumped in too believing they were all doing the right thing or perhaps they just didnt want to be on the outer. No one wanted to have the moralistic finger pointed at them so they joined in lest they be ridiculed too.
It's really a power grab and nothing more with films, advertising and TV as part of the propaganda. Even if you analyse it on a purely basic entertainment level, they fail miserably. This film is just one example.
The audience can suspend their belief that there exists a powerful alien. They know far better than to accept an all-powerful Mary Sue. At least for those who like their entertainment with a shred of credibility."
PREY,"A worthy prequel to the classic I think Prey did an excellent job at crafting a fresh new story. Let's face it, predictor sequels and spin-offs have felt more like a money grab. But here there's a real story that cleverly weaves a number of story lines together to spin up this intriguing edition.
Amber Midthunder more than holds her own and keeps the pace moving. And the movie does a great job at leveraging the historical context for maximum effect.
Big thumbs up from me."
PREY,Just so-so (one spoiler) 
PREY,"Who's the Prey and who's the Predator?? I was only going to rate this until I decided to read some of the comments. This was easily the best one since the original. Not even close to me. I was hopefully when Shane Black did a ""reboot"" in 2018 I believe. I was disappointed. This was taking the franchise back to the basics and that was a good think! If you liked what Rogue One meant to Star Wars then this story will connect with you. I loved the cinematography. It was beautiful. The acting was really good. Don't worry that the lead actors aren't more well known. I was really not expecting much to be honest. The sequels since The Predator have been let downs. I only watched because the trailer had me with taking it so far back in time. At an hour and forty min it wasn't too short or too long. It was the perfect run time. I hope that you like Prey as much as me and that you rate and leave a comment. Happy hunting!"
PREY,Please don't believe the hype 
PREY,"Huge waste of time Huge waste of time.
The movie was so boring that i just could not believe it.
What was the point of this whole thing? I just don't get it. Are they trying to be relevant, up to date with world's issues, especially the one when suddenly women are the main heroes in all the movies. Slap to the face and roll my eyes.
The movie is an embarrassment to the name Predator. I mean, this strong and powerful alien creature was easily killed by a whimpy girl who can't even fight boys her age (cos she got her ass kicked by her fellow tribe boys), but she overpowered the Predator with a few slaps.
You people are killing off all the good movies and franchises. So sad to see that this piece of s*** has such a huge rating, undeservingly so."
PREY,"Prey marks a return to form for the Predator franchise with a unique take on the material and solid lead in Midthunder. Set in 1719 in The Great Northern Plains, Naru (Amber Midthunder) is a young Comanche woman who while trained as a healer has aspirations of being a hunter like her brother Taabe (Dakota Beavers). When Naru sees what she thinks is the ""thunderbird"" in the sky, she takes this as a sign she is ready to prove herself a hunter. As she joins a group lead by her brother set on taking down a mountain lion, they soon come across a creature more dangerous than they've encountered before.
Prey marks the first Predator movie made and released since Disney bought Fox and the first entry in the series since the underperformance of 2018's The Predator. The film began development under the working title of Skulls when director Dan Trachtenberg and screenwriter Patrick Aison approached series producer John Davis with the initial concept that would become Prey. Trachtenberg hasn't directed a feature film his breakout hit in 2016's 10 Cloverfield Lane with a number of projects he's been attached to either moving on without him or getting cancelled with Trachtenberg's largely being on TV. Prey marks both a welcome return for Trachtenberg as well as the Predator franchise as it's probably the best entry we've had since the first one.
Much like prior films Predator and Predator 2 which took established film staples such as commando and cop movies and turned them on their head with the inclusion of an alien trophy hunter, Prey takes a set of characters in its Comanche natives who could've easily sustained their own movie independent of The Predator and make for an engaging mashup with the established monster much as they did with the characters in the first and second films. Amber Midthunder is our lead Naru and she's really good in the film as she's capable in the fight scenes but also is very green which helps sell the rougher edge to the fight scenes which include some of the clumsiness you'd expect from such skirmishes. The other actors are solid performers and lend themselves to some entertaining and very brutal sequences in the film, including a sequence in the third act which had a nice nod to the ending of Predator 2. The Predator design is really unique featuring a cruder version of the helmet that more resembles a skull than the one we're used to and it works in context. We also get a solid dog character in Sarii who's pretty much a co-lead in the film and they're every bit the character you'd expect from a human actor.
Prey is solid genre fare in its own right, but it also brings the Predator series back on track after getting derailed with the mess of 2018's The Predator. Amber Midthunder is a great lead as Naru and the action and spectacle delivers. The third act runs a bit long and maybe could've been streamlined, but aside from that this is great enetertainment."
PREY,"Definitely worth your time!! Had to start a 30-day trial on Hulu just to watch it but It was pretty boss, so I'm not mad. The story was basic and took us back to the roots of the Predator franchise with its pre-America setting.
Like the new predator deign but far more impressed by how the new predator moved and reacted. Whoever they got in the costume was really doing some acting, making himself look like the baddest hunter on the block. It does not stand out any better than any of the other Predator movies in my book but as far as being the first one by 20th Century Studios done under the Disney Banner it was violent and gory enough for my taste.
Worth possibly getting Hulu for."
PREY,Honest review: good setting but the rest is flawed and sloppy and doesn't do the greatest hunter in the galaxy justice.. 
PREY,"How does this get almost the same imdb score as the Arnie original? Watching the Hollywood machine take your favourite childhood movies, TV shows and books and butcher them over and over and over again. It's growing tiresome.
The Predator itself is a macguffin, Hollywood have somehow turned a macguffin into a franchise, each film worse than the last.
This latest effort is a snooze. There is no suspense, nothing new is added to the Predator mythology, the action descends into farce. The action can just about stay within suspension of disbelief until the little girl starts directly fighting the Predator and winning. She sustains blows that would render Thor a tetraplegic and just keeps on going. What a gal.
This is the Predator franchise reduced to a cartoon for tween girls who cannot even watch the film due to its certification.
I'm getting really sick of watching the latest effort in a popular entertainment series and thinking to myself ""I hope they don't make anymore""."
PREY,Predator Never Knew What Hit Him! 
PREY,"unbelievable In the land of make-believe its unbelievable. This is the least entertaining, and most ridiculous of the Predator movies. The main charter has a chip on her shoulder that makes her unlikeable. She goes from entitled Instagram model to an axe-wielding master ninja in just hours. Another of many things that bothered me about this movie was how she instantly understands the technical aspects of alien weaponry enough to use it against the Predator. Really? The story makes no sense. The Predators have always gone after the most dangerous threats, but for some unknown reason, this Predator seems out to get her."
PREY,Surprisingly overrated 
PREY,"Not as good as previous chapter! Full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Another big letdown! "
PREY,"Made by another talentless modern privileged urbanized hipster... ...aimed at priviliged urbanized gen Z hipsters lacking an identity of their own. Another movie that lacks soul, depth and storytelling like most modern made Predator themed flicks and putting in indigenous american hipster actors and actresses from the narcissistic hollywood elite doesn't give it any cred by default. The most interesting part in this flick was perhaps that girl's tomahawk skills, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was cgi too like most biological life in this film..."
PREY,This was really awful 
PREY,Boring and Predictable 
PREY,It was made well but totally woke and ridiculous premise Right a 12 year old little girl is the hero and all the tough manly males fail. Ridiculous. It wasn't badly made but the agenda is always in your face to put women over men and now children over men.
PREY,"Boring and Pointless Probably the most ""serious"" film in the Predator series but might as well be the most boring one, except for the AVP abominations (if you consider them as part of the franchise). Even the awful ""The Predator"" has more to offer on terms of plot and excitement. I appreciate the filmmakers took the movie seriously and didn't make it the silly movie that is ""The Predators"" but that doesn't make this one good either. Sorry, I don't understand why people like it so much. I found it pretty dull and pointless. Also, the references to Predator 1 and 2 were pretty heavy handed."
PREY,"great Predator film It's 1719 on the American plains. Naru (Amber Midthunder) is a young Comanche woman who wants to be a great hunter. Her brother Taabe is a natural born leader. The world of the white people is slowly intruding on their world. A strange thunder cloud announces a different unwelcomed extraterrestrial visitor. It's the Predator.
I love two thirds of this movie. I love Naru slowly uncovering the Predator's presence. I love this native American world and everybody's performances. It is better than anything since the newness of the original. I do have an issue with the final battle. The more daring ending would be an epic death. I never got the sense that she could prevail over the Predator. I prefer the non Hollywood happy ending. Nevertheless, this is still a great Predator film."
PREY,"Horrible, nonsense "
FIFTY SHADES OF GREY,"Oh this film was just DREADFUL! Okay. So I have not read the book, (being a male), and I went with one of my female friends who HAD read the book, (and she said she had enjoyed it) -- although having said that, she had read it a number of years ago.
 We paid our money and we took our seats. The film began; and I have to say that the wooden acting, the cruddy screenplay, the corny dialogue, the ridiculous script, the highly improbable storyline, were all just TOO much for us! (And not just us it seems! As we could hear titters from the audience at large as well coming from dialogue within the story that were supposed to be serious scenes -- so not just us I hasten to add)...
 We gave it half an hour and then I leaned over to my friend and said ""Do you think there's any chance they will give us our money back?? What do you think to it?"" -- and thank God she replied, ""Oh thank Heavens you said that; I can't stand it another minute! Lets just get outta here!!!!!!! It's just terrible"".
 We got our money back. We complained it was nothing like the book and that we demanded a refund as had only seen half an hour of the movie, and hey presto they refunded my credit card! No questions asked!
 I give this rubbish 1 star; and that was for the pretty outdoor scenery!
 Don't waste your time with it -- it is Hollywood at it's worst."
FIFTY SHADES OF GREY,This used to be call porn.
FIFTY SHADES OF GREY,"100 Shades of Terrible. I was in the mood for a great film about a young girl who meets a successful and seductive businessman with sexy results. This was not the case. This film was purely awful. No one can blame me for not being in the right frame of mind for the cinema, as some reviewers are. They see a film and end up having a bad night and they put the entire blame on the film, this is not the case for me. I was in a positive frame of mind, and really in the mood to see what I thought would be a somewhat good if not better than mediocre film.
 This film is about two people who have no chemistry ""falling"" for each other. ""Falling"" like off a three story balcony leaving you without the use of your legs for the rest of your life. I'm just going to be blunt. This film is about GLORIFYING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE and a little girl in over her head who tolerates it. The man in the relationship, Chris, in a career-ending performance portrayed by Jamie Doormat, is a control-freak who must be in control in everything he does, including the life of his BDSM buddy, Ana.
 Not only does he creep onto her, HE BEATS HER, non-consensually while they have intercourse, he stalks her, HE INTIMIDATES HER and he shows no love for her. If this were any other film, he would be the antagonist. If you're in the mood for a movie that shows what true love is, I suggest you see Mrs. Doubtfire, as that film is about a loving family man who shows his dedication and support to his wife, even after they are separated, and his children, by dressing up as an elderly female babysitter.
 50 Shades of Brown gets 1/10 stars from me as I am unable to give A BIG FAT ZERO."
FIFTY SHADES OF GREY,Flippity-flop.
FIFTY SHADES OF GREY,"Yeah, I'm sorry, it is that bad ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is based on a badly written book, so why someone thought they could make a decent film out of it is beyond me. Actually I don't think anyone believed they could make a good film, the producers just wanted the money that would come in from all people who for reasons known only to themselves read the book.
 I had a free ticket and I had to go in order to do a story on it. Bottom line, I'm not doing a story on it.
 Okay, here's the problem, and this is what breaks my heart. We no longer know what good or great is. I am no follower of Ayn Rand, but in The Fountainhead, she predicted the rise of mediocrity, mediocrity being considered great and the norm we shoot for. It only stands to reason that at this point, some things can't even rise to that sad level. This isn't mediocre, it's pathetic. I can't believe there are people complimenting the actors. But then I can, because they have come to accept mediocrity. Something I fight against with all my heart.
 There is one other problem. The book sucked; in order to like it, one had to use his or her imagination. The success of this book lay in the fantasy aspect. Sometimes imagination is more powerful than just about anything and can give you an erotic experience. This film doesn't fulfill the most inane imagination, let alone someone who really has a wild and creative one. The only fantasy it can give you is how fast you can get out of the theater.
 There were people around me laughing. The ones who weren't left, and from what I found out in the lobby, actually demanded and got their money back. When was the last time you saw people leaving a movie in the middle? I'm not sure I've ever seen it, and I'll guess I've been going to movies longer than a lot of you.
 I lament the loss of artistic soul, of creativity, of going for the best. I miss the days when Billy Wilder was a writer and a filmmaker. What are we left with but a horrible book written on a first grade level and the resulting bad movie."
FIFTY SHADES OF GREY,Terrible to BDSM Community and to Women.
FIFTY SHADES OF GREY,Keeping it short
FIFTY SHADES OF GREY,"I enjoyed this movie very much, I'm a guy, am I normal ?"
FIFTY SHADES OF GREY,Fifty Shades of No.
FIFTY SHADES OF GREY,"I don't see what everyone's problem is I don't know what people were expecting. I hadn't read the books before seeing the movie and I am assuming that maybe this was a good thing. I enjoyed the film. I do not agree with the lack of chemistry either. There was a weird chemistry which I believe made sense because of the unusual relationship. He is an odd character and she is intimidated and is also very innocent therefore it isn't going to be the usual sexual chemistry that you would find in a romantic film. A lot of people have said there was not enough sex or it was not raunchy enough. Firstly, if there were any more sex scenes it would have got quite boring, and instead we got to see a bit of a story line. Also there is only so much that they can show in a film, surely? What were people expecting? Also one final point in relation to the comments I have seen regarding the film giving S&M a bad name; I don't agree. This is a specific story about one guy who is into specific things and goes about things a particular way. It was all consensual (and it is made clear that it must be). The whole point of the story is that Christian Grey's sexual desires are confusing for Anatasia to understand and that the relationship is quite complicated due to their mutual feelings for each other. I have also seen comments that this film is sexist and degrades women. This film does not promote that at all it merely shows a story of someone who practises in S&M and in this instance the man is the dominant. She has a choice as to whether she wants to engage in this and the film does not say ""this is okay"" and ""woman should do this"". The character was not forced to do anything. I do not get why people feel the need to accuse films of implying or portraying such things.
 Obviously this film is not perfect and there are things that could have been better but I enjoyed this film and personally would recommend it to others. I can get quite bored in films but I was not bored at all, I have paid more to see films that are A LOT worse than this."
FIFTY SHADES OF GREY,My Faith in Humanity Has Gone
FIFTY SHADES OF GREY,About that special place in hell...
FIFTY SHADES OF GREY,Really really bad
FIFTY SHADES OF GREY,Jamie
FIFTY SHADES OF GREY,"Review based on the movie, I haven't read the books There was absolutely no chemistry between the main actors.
 The sex is about as sensual as a log of wood thrown on the road.
 The sets and art direction are excellent and create the perfect ambiance.
 The music is all right in terms of theme and pacing.
 She was irritating and there were way too many close-ups of her. Neither her features nor her mannerism could hold it.
 He was every bit of gorgeous, but with a rather wooden performance; no pun intended, because he's as sensual as last year's sock.
 Will I be watching Part II ? NAY.
 Will I be reading any of the books ? NAY."
FIFTY SHADES OF GREY,"A Fascinating, Erotic Film Perhaps Better Than We Give It Credit For Before the review, I think I should address one important thing: I have never read the book. That being said, you will not read any comparisons or critiques of what was left out or what was done wrong in the adaptation. I went into this movie aware of the subject matter and judged it just like any other movie. Consider this a fair review of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"".
 Honestly, I liked this movie. I know what you're thinking: ""This guy just likes seeing people have kinky sex on the big screen."" No, I don't. In fact, I think mainstream erotic films offer us more than just artsy porn; they can be a fascinating look into the human subconscious like ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and they can be pure garbage like ""Caligula"". I have come to learn that art is not safe whether it's in the horror genre, comedy or especially in the erotic subgenre. Strangely, I found ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" to be provocative of questions about love, compromise, and passion even if it borders on what most people would consider bad taste.
 First off, what is the movie about? Basically it follows the relationship between an inhibited English student named Anastasia Steele (played by Dakota Johnson) and a mysterious, young billionaire named Christian Grey (played by Jamie Dornan). They meet for an interview and begin building an infatuation for one another but Grey keeps insisting he does not want a romance with Ana. Instead he offers her the chance to partake in a BDSM relationship in which he is the dominant and she is the submissive. When I look back, the roles match well with their personalities.
 There is no real story I could find in this film; rather it's more about the characters. A lot of great movies focus on their characters more than plot; in this movie, it works out okay. Many of the supporting characters are snubbed for the two main players as if to say they are just there for the sake of some filler. Maybe if others found out about Grey's lifestyle and he was caught in media frenzy, the film would have a substantial plot.
 I found Dakota Johnson to be incredibly dull in the first act but gradually she becomes more dynamic and confident as the film progressed. It feels intentional seeing how Ana starts off as a quiet, uninteresting woman only to morph into a more liberal persona. Dakota's character has a lot of those ""whomp-whomp-whomp-whooooomp"" comedic moments in the beginning which felt so forced and unnecessary to the tone. Jamie Dornan was decent as Christian Grey. Like his character, he feels in control.
 The sex scenes are a lot tamer than I had anticipated going into this flick. Like the rest of the movie, they are shot surprisingly crisp and, might I add, nicely-paced.
 It sounds like a simple movie but it wasn't until I asked myself one simple question that it all became interesting: Does Grey love Ana? A lot of Grey's actions I see points to yes unless it is part of a ploy to secure a potential submissive. He claims to require a written contract before ever touching Ana but blows off this condition to passionately kiss her. And once they get to the contract, they discuss their intimate limitations in an amusing, business-like setting. Ana objects to certain practices which Grey seems to willingly extract from their relationship kind of like a compromise in any other relationship.
 One of my favorite parts is when Ana confesses her virginity to Grey after revealing his secret life. Even though he maintains he doesn't have normal sexual relations in the bedroom, Grey breaks this code to be with Ana. One might argue it is a selfish act to gain her trust so she may serve as his victim; I see it as Grey finding an opportunity to be with someone he could briefly connect with, someone untouched, someone he sees as good. In fact, at one point, he voices his concern of Ana changing his outlook on life and sounds scared of this prospect. Grey feels constrained by his past which shaped his present only to feel the need to constrain others to his level, literally.
 Who knows? Maybe I'm overthinking too much. Some people might be turned off, some might get turned on, some might think little about it, and some might find something special in ""Fifty Shades of Grey"". I only know what I saw and felt.
 My Rating: 7/10"
FIFTY SHADES OF GREY,"Terrible I viewed this film and my immediate thought was, ""How come this movie has no storyline?"" This was a film comparable to a nickelodeon cartoon series, or quite possibly worse. If I could rate any lower, it would be a -3 out of 10. All this movie is doing is exploiting the emotions of women across the globe, and ts ripping things that started on tumblr, this just makes the cinema that much worse. I saw a movie by Disney and i vomited during the first five minutes of it, and that was better than this film. >Go on a date with girl >Take her to nice restaurant >She orders a shrimp cocktail and several drinks >Ask for the check >The waiter places the check in front of me, not in front of her, not in the middle of the table >Look of horror comes across the girl's face >I reach for the check and place my credit card inside >She begins to tremble >Tears well up in her eyes >I can tell she is paralyzed by fear at the oppression she is experiencing >I chauvinistically place the check with the my credit card on the table in front of me, daring her to do something about it >The power of my oppression of this woman surges through my body as I lean back in my seat and stare directly at her >She is shaking with fright, the oppression strangling her voice away >The waiter returns to take the check away >All is lost to her now >Men at other tables begin to stand up and clap >Women all over the restaurant begin to shriek and cry >I feel my erect penis lift the tablecloth in front of me >I ask my date, ""Did you enjoy your dinner?"" >""Y-yes... thank you"", she says behind a mask of tears >I lean forward, a devious, patriarchical smile spreading across my face >And I tell her, ""It was my privilege."""

FIFTY SHADES OF GREY,50 shades of the best marketing ever
FIFTY SHADES OF GREY,"OMG, this is SO bad."
FIFTY SHADES OF GREY,"While Johnson and Dorman light up the screen, but the film falters behind the scenes. 50 Shades of Grey has now reached classic status among women who marvel over this book and while I don't quite get why, I respect the hell out of EL James and applaud her for her ability to make something so daring and racy. However, now that it has now jumped from the page to the screen it has something to it that keeps you watching but ultimately leaves you befuddled about what it is truly about. Objectification, vanity, feminism, masochistic sexual urges, these are all themes this film plays with but just can't seem to pinpoint an exact one it wants to stick with. The screenplay for this is a muddled piece of writing that lazily skates through its near two hour runtime with looks from Grey to Ana and no real dialog that is clever or even remotely interesting. The performances in this film are what keeps you watching. Jamie Dorman and Dakota Johnson are electrifying as Christian Grey and Ana, the two of them definitely took their jobs seriously here both physically and mentally and it absolutely pays off as much as it can considering the script they were working with. There's not a false note with their portrayals here but it does seem hard to judge when so much of the film relies on glares and one word answers. While Kelly Marcel tries to make the fans happy, it ends up hurting the film's chances of actually being good because there's just so much to say here regarding the characters and she ends up not saying anything, leaving us craving more of a connection with the characters that just simply wasn't done very well. One thing that is focused on more so than anything else are the sex scenes. They're intense, realistic and very personal and they remain the highlight of the film considering we learn the most about the characters when they're having an orgasm. There's only so much you can put into a movie especially if the source material is as sordid as this but Sam Taylor-Johnson doesn't disappoint when showing you the savage sexual nature of the infamous Christian Grey. These sex scenes push the boundaries of its R rating and fans of the book should be happy to hear that they can finally visualize some of the titillating details James seems to love to describe in her book. Despite the sex scenes being very well done and carefully filmed, the rest of the scenes feel lacking. Dorman and Johnson are screaming for a better script, its a real shame that Sam Taylor-Johnson and Kelly Marcel are seemingly asleep behind the wheel. Overall, 50 Shades of Grey is very well done in its look and feel but beneath the surface of it all, there isn't much going on outside its sex scenes."
FIFTY SHADES FREED,"Fifty Shades Bored to Death I have to be honest. I am not a fan of the series. Nor the books nor the films. It just didn't speak to me. However... My better half insisted this will be a fun movie. She prepared me it is no Dostoyevsky we were about to see but god almighty was I in shock how far it went. This must be the least coherent, most half-arsed, pointless movies I have ever seen in this sharade we call life. The sheer boredom spread through the unbearable laziness of the script, the empty looks of the actors, the meaningless cuts, senseless sequnces of the scenes... I just couldn't believed it... This was greenlit by someone?! Good god. Made me miss Twilight..."

FIFTY SHADES FREED,"Well.. Black Panther still looks good, right? Here we go again..
 I genuinely hoped.. there would've been change.
 Sadly, I have to state the obvious: this is among the worst trilogies of film-making I' ve seen.
 Acting? Bad. They were both there for a paycheck and nothing else.
 Story? Well you see them getting married in the trailer.. and then you see her ex-boss picking up a gun, right? well there you have it.
 Cinematogrophy: Worst than the first, but better than the second. Nothing to add there.
 Dialogue: ... let's not go there..
 All in all, i would give it a 1/10, because it was nice to look at some landscape for time to time. This review is short, because the movie was done short. it was bad from beginning to end, with horrible dialogue, with unstable emotions of both characters.. you get a sense of where this franchise couldve gone and done it right at the very end... but by then it meant nothing. god... I hate the writer who wrote it and I condemn writers like that back to wherever they came from."
FIFTY SHADES FREED,"Fifty Cents Worth Finally the franchise is over. For me, this trilogy was a complete torture. What is that a new modern Cinderella with taste for boundage? I just can¬¥t believe some ""critics"" reviewed this title with a 10 just to upgrade de rating: Nice try, it didn¬¥t work. There is a bunch of surrealistic characters that reminds me of the Twilight saga. This is like soft erotica for soppy widows, a raisy magazine for feminist, S&M encyclopedia for Dummies. I can¬¥t believe i watch this. But i can recognize it was fan at first, just for the greatest hype. Then, it felt it was a completely waste of time.

FIFTY SHADES FREED,"Makes a hero out of a #MeToo culprit (Christian Grey), and romanticizes stalking and sexual harassment! 'FIFTY SHADES FREED': Zero Stars (Out of Five)
 The third installment in the blockbuster erotic romantic thriller series, based on the three hit books (beginning with 'Fifty Shade of Grey') by E.L. James. In this chapter Ana and Christian are finally getting used to a more stable relationship together, although it's still really kinky and abusive, when a stalker from Ana's past continues to ruin their happiness. The film was directed by James Foley and written by Niall Leonard (the same duo also performed both duties on the last sequel), and Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan once again reprise their starring roles (for the third time). The movie also costars Eric Johnson, Max Martini, Brant Daugherty, Eloise Mumford, Rita Ora and Luke Grimes. It's received almost unanimously negative reviews from critics once again (like the others), but it is expected to be another hit at the Box Office though (like the others). I once again hated it.
 Ana (Dakota Johnson) and Christian (Jamie Dornan) are married, and finally starting to live a happy life together. Christian can't relax though, as he's constantly worried about Ana's safety. Especially when the couple realizes that Ana's ex-boss, Jack Hyde (Eric Johnson), who also sexually assaulted her, is out of prison and stalking her. Christian does everything he can to try to keep Ana safe, including commanding her on where and when she has to be somewhere, but Ana wants her freedom, and doesn't listen. The couple's new happiness is of course soon jeopardized because of this. I've hated this series from the beginning, because it makes a hero out of a #MeToo culprit (Christian Grey), and romanticizes stalking and sexual harassment. These are both things that the Christian character is guilty of doing to Ana, in the first two installments of the franchise. In this one his abuse towards her is at least seemingly consensual, but it still seems like the wrong message to send viewers (and readers of the novels). So I've always had a problem with the morality of supporting these films and books, and I don't understand why any intelligent moral person would. I've only continued to see each movie so that I can review them; in order to speak my feelings on this subject, and it's also just a lot more fun to review a bad film than a good one. This one is a really bad movie as well, and it's even worse than the first two installments. It seems like just a series of random pointless scenes strung together, by the weakest example of a plot that I've seen in a film in quite some time, just so they can give the viewer lots of erotic excessive sex scenes (as well as lots of pointless nudity). The movie really just feels like a well produced porno, but of course it's a heavy R-rated version of one (rather than X-rated)."
FIFTY SHADES FREED,"Fifty Shades of much needed freedom Hopefully, as a heterosexual female student in her mid twenties, saying this before the male critic hating and age generalisations continue, with a love of film that spreads across all genres and decades, this will come over as a fair assessment of a film that genuinely did nothing for me. Very like what was said with the first two 'Fifty Shades' films.
 As was said before, my main reasons for seeing 'Fifty Shades Freed', wanting to see as many films of this year and of the latter half of 2017 (some released in my country this year) and that it just happened to be the film choice of a friend cinema film outing. General consensus of the group for the record being indifference and passionately hating it. Not because of wanting to hate it (have always aimed to be a fair and perceptive reviewer), following the crowd (have been known to go against the grain) or being someone who hates everything (generally am a positive reviewer and try to see the good in even awful films). And yes, am telling the truth about seeing it, have never reviewed a film without watching it.
 Oh and the whole ""why did you even watch it"" rubbish, from those who denounce anybody who dislikes the film as trolls for having a different opinion, needs to stop, because it comes over as ignorant and disrespectful. People are allowed to judge whatever they want and the two most common reasons for seeing a film is completest sake (if trying to see as many films of the year as possible) and family and friend film nights and cinema outings, so that answers that question.
 Which is the case here in 'Fifty Shades Freed'. Am not going to give it the lowest rating on IMDb, this is an extremely rare rating for me these days and reserved only for incompetently made films with no effort put into them. 'Fifty Shades Freed' has very little good with it, but there are also a few things good. It is the best of the 'Fifty Shades' trilogy, as there is a little more plot than the previous two, sadly this is not saying much.
 Some of the soundtrack beguiles, it has a soothing nostalgia and appropriately amorous quality. Those lovely moments in the soundtrack, which should have been maintained more consistently, is the best thing about 'Fifty Shades Freed'.
 It also looks good, nice use of scenery and very nicely shot. There is one acting bright spot, which is Marcia Gay Harden who does very well with her role and is too conscientious an actress.
 However, the same flaws are all here. Other parts of Danny Elfman's score are one-note and repetitive, as well as too derivative of his recent work. He has composed some wonderful stuff ('Edward Scissorhands' is magical) but this is really not his best work. The same goes with director James Foley, whose direction is far too mannered and ill at ease, he has done some great stuff like 'Glenngarry Glenn Ross' and 'House of Cards' and when you compare his work on those and that for his contribution to the 'Fifty Shades' films it's like somebody else entirely.
 Regarding the cast, only Harden is good. The rest fail to register in one-dimensional and in many cases underwritten and under-utilised roles. Eric Johnson phones it in at some parts and overdoes it in others as the painfully clich√©d villain. More problematic once more are the two leads, and the chemistry is next to zero once more. Understated can be a lovely quality to acting, as long as it also becomes nuanced and with believability given to the dialogue. Dakota Johnson, especially in the first third, is too understated that it feels more like there is a lack of personality or emotion. Jamie Dornan looks uncomfortable throughout, delivers his cringe-worthy lines awkwardly and is just bland as dishwater with no charisma whatsoever. Chemistry is non-existent.
 Again, the dialogue does no favours, dialogue so bad that absolutely nobody (even the best actors and actresses) can do anything with it. It would even be beneath actors and actresses who can't act to save their lives, and there is just as plenty of those around. It causes unintentional laughter throughout, is embarrassingly clunky and is pure smut. Then there is the story, even though it is the film with the most plot it still is so thin structurally, heavy in repetition, so badly plodding and without style or atmosphere that the film feels twice as long. Even with attempts to give more raunchiness and kinkiness, as well as edge, none of what goes on comes over naturally. Everything is horribly contrived and silly, with a climax that feels out of place and conflict that lacks tension and is instead unintentionally silly. The sex scenes are passionless and less than erotic.
 Concluding, while very marginally the best of the three 'Fifty Shades Freed' pretty dreadful still. It is very early on in the year but my prediction will be by the end of it the film would still be one of the worst of the year. 2/10 Bethany Cox"
FIFTY SHADES FREED,"Obviously the best of this series The first of the three that is actually emotionally intense. The film felt short compared to the book, but that's normal. Also, while watching, I found myself making cinematic connections between this and the last 2 Twilight movies, which was funny, especially given E.L. James's start as a fan fiction author. Is it an Oscar-worthy performance? No. Is it entertaining for a week night after a long day at work? Yes."
FIFTY SHADES FREED,"It is what it is. And it does what it does pretty well. People who are overly critical of this series miss the point. ""Fifty Shades Freed"" (R, 1:45) is the third and final installment in the trilogy of erotic S&M-tinged movies based on the novels by E.L. James (after 2015's ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" and 2017's ""Fifty Shades Darker""). This one begins where most romantic films end - with a wedding. Having accepted the sweet marriage proposal of troubled billionaire entrepreneur Christian Gray (Jamie Dornan) at the end of the second film, book editor Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) vows her faithfulness and devotion to her beloved in the first scene of this film and he responds in kind. They're over-the-moon happy. Then reality sets in.
 Mr. and Mrs. Gray have to cut their honeymoon in France short when Christian receives a phone call about a data breach and fire in his corporate offices. They quickly discover that the perpetrator is an old enemy, but they're not sure what he's after. As Christian works his back channels to find out (and keeping much of what he finds from his new wife), the two of them struggle through many of the growing pains which most newlyweds deal with - but it all seems to come up in a very condensed period of time. Should she go by ""Mrs. Gray"" or ""Ms. Steele"" at work? (And should/does he have any say in the matter?) How much control should they have over each other's lives and activities? (especially since control has always been such a theme and point of contention in their relationship) Do they want kids? (How the hell did they not discuss this before they got married??) Oh, and how much personal security should she have? (Like I said, typical newlywed issues.) And then there's the growing threat from the someone(s) from their past - who is seriously f****ing with them... while they f*** each other... often.
 Yes, even with everything else going on, there are still plenty of sex scenes (both the typical kind and the kinky), but the sex (especially the S&M) almost takes a back seat to the plot at this point in Christian and Ana's saga. As in the two previous films, the conflicts feel contrived, but they do add some extra layers of drama to this story - and even some danger and suspense. In my opinion, the first film had the most exciting sex scenes, the second one had the best story and this one has the best mix of elements. None of these movies are going to be confused with high cinematic art, but they still can be pretty enjoyable, if you accept them for what they are - sexy romantic fantasy. After all, that's what E.L. James' series of books is about (as amateurishly written as they are) and isn't escapism one reason we go to the movies? This one is pretty entertaining in its genre, especially for fans of the books, and that's good enough. ""B+"""
FIFTY SHADES FREED,Toxic junk
FIFTY SHADES FREED,"One of the wrost movies I have ever seen So my wife convinced me to see this Saturday night. I figured I was buzzed enough to at least enjoy the sex scenes. But the movie was SO BAD that not even that could save it. The script and acting is among the worst I have ever seen. Totally not believable. Whatever you do, DO NOT waste your time and money on this."
FIFTY SHADES FREED,"What a great movie franchise - said NOBODY! Why do they even keep making, re-making this awful excuse of cinema garbage? Seriously, who watches this crap? Lonely cat ladies who have missed out on dating and sex and now feel angry about it that they must watch this annoyingly unnecessary movie? And 3rd time in the series!!! Are you kidding me??? Who pays for this?!!!
 There are better ways to spend your money!
 Can't wait for this franchise to just go bankrupt already."
FIFTY SHADES FREED,Finally I am just glad there is a Mrs. Grey and they have a family. Actually much better than the first two Fifty Shades. But this was by far my favorite (Freed) Message: How to Love a Difficult Man in these Fifty Shades Movies. Love Finally Conquered all. Yes I actually watch this movie over and over. We all have dark secrets which can destroy us. Wounds that take time to heal. Someone to finally accept you as you are. True Love. I admit the Movie wasn't Perfect. But Think the relationship in the Fifty Shades were not either. Lastly the Fifty Shades Movie Soundtracks were so worthed.
FIFTY SHADES FREED,"What not to watch Fist of all I when to watch this movie knowing that this may be more lacking than the other two before. I really was not expecting this much of lacking, I didn't even know if I should have party because it was finally over this toured or if I should I cry. This movie cut not only the good parts but also the Christian Grey dominate persona. They give all to Anastasia and that was just to much to my like, they only part that I can applaud is the one that she is facing with valor that an unwanted pregnancy and she is willing to take care of the baby with or without him. That can teach some woman that you don't need a man to survival and much lest to father a child. But overall I cannot even star this film, it was a deception one after the other , music was great but nothing compare to the first film music. Farewell Fifty Shades of Nothing"
FIFTY SHADES FREED,"thank god they end the franchise Fifty Shades freed is just like the previous installment, some changes which are so minor like anna and grey go married, anna got pregnant, i don;t know why they stretched the movie, oh its torture not to be called a movie, because movie have story, there just added more various sex scenes i different position and times, that's new thing in the whole movie, anna looks beautiful otherwise she have nothing to do, cheesy dialogue delivery from her body language, and then talk about grey, he also not good in sex scenes, he have some muture dialogue other wise he looks sex obsessed man like previous installments, his decent sex obsessed man personality not suits him, and also have an robotic expressions on whole movie, so there is no good performance, not a good story here! don't watch it, if you are looking for a porn film so also don;t watch it, because of old sex scenes like previous fifty shades movies but have some different styles, you know what i mean."
FIFTY SHADES FREED,"Yes, 10/10 again for Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan"
FIFTY SHADES FREED,"Easy Cum, Easy Go Summed up in five words:
 A truly awful, awful movie!"
FIFTY SHADES FREED,"Best action-thriller-horror trilogy ever I love this movie!! Its great!! Such acting skills! Wow! Much sex! Such joy! The fight scenes were amazing. Its like Jackie Chan with tits and butt-plug! Wow. Amazing! The helicopter chase scene was good - its like interstellar and marix with butt-plugs and handcuffs !!!
 P.s. The movie theater was a sell-out. I wasnt expecting so many people to cum..."
FIFTY SHADES FREED,"Waste of Money. Absolute valentines day trap. If I could give a 0/10 rating I would. Christian's character has nothing interesting left to offer. Anastasia was scripted to seem like she is taking initiative (somewhat) and defying christian but her acting is clumsy and she does an awful job at coming across as even slightly empowered. The only good acting in the entire film comes from the banker. The plot is lazily thrown together and the attempts at suspense are god awful. The only people who will enjoy or defend this movie are absolute die hard fans. If you consider yourself a movie buff or even just someone who casually enjoys movies, DO NOT SEE THIS. I will spare you the frustration. I even enjoy bad movies, I love having fun with a bad movie and making jokes about it to my friends while we watch it. I did that in this film but even that was not enough to make this an enjoyable experience. The ""BDSM"" in this film is a sad sad portrayal that only the oldest, driest, and most sexually frustrated wine moms will find arousing. A TSA pat-down is kinkier than this excuse for erotica. The sex scenes feel very required and obtuse. The ending is a horrible attempt to tie things up and make them feel complete, it is incredibly cheesy, as is every single bit of dialogue in this film. I can't even continue to review this because if I do I will need to down a bottle of excedrin. Just don't waste your money."
FIFTY SHADES FREED,"Don't look for ratings. It is something about the story but about passion, love, romance and commitment. I don't think any other series could give you that much of feeling of love that this gives. This is the best franchise about love with best romantic music in this world."
FIFTY SHADES FREED,Much better than Darker Finally we have an installment that is better than the second one. I am happy that I didn't watch the trailer. Nice way to end it. Finally free..Let's hope Dakota's career will shine after also!
FIFTY SHADES FREED,"A lot of eye candy, but not much else"
FIFTY SHADES FREED,"Missed the climax, and the plot"
FIFTY SHADES FREED,"Hopefully the end ... hopfully no more sequels This film isnt worth any money to watch it ... or even the time you need to invest.
 The plot can be quickly summarized ... the main characters of Christian Grey and Anastacia Steel got married before this movie. They seems to be in a happy relationship but an old problem in form of former manager of Anastacia Steel is threatening their happy new life.
 That's it. More plot this movie doesnt provide. How it comes that this movie takes so long with such a bad plot? The gaps are filled with bad sex scenes, bad jokes every than and now and a relationship based on abuse.
 As a openly living BDSM follower this movie and the books hurting every inch of me. And not in the good way. If you really want to watch this movie, I recommend to do this with big attentation on details and you will quickly notice, that the 'relationship' between Anastacia and Christian are based on nothing more than abuse.
 Besides of this the acting is again not authentic or even good. For a happily married couple their is no feeling about this fact that you would think this is the case. You have to watch the second movie to believe it. But I dont want to talk the actors down, it mostly is because of the script.
 The scenery is again nice but only because of this I cant recommend the movie in any way. The movie music is bad as in the movies before this and dont fit to the actual scene which helps you with enjoying the film by laughing in the wrong moments.
 Why I still watched the film? Well, a running gag between my friends and me. After my first shocked reactions about such a bad movie based on such a bad book, my fellows like to watch my reactions which falter between disbelief, shock and second-hand embarrassment.
 If you never watched this movie. Dont do it!"
FIFTY SHADES FREED,No revenge sex in the red room.
FIFTY SHADES DARKER,"Neither as good or as bad as so many commentators seem to think Neither as good or as bad as so many commentators seem to think. It has high production values. The direction is unobtrusive. I haven't read the novels, so cannot really comment on the source material. Dakota Johnson hit the corruptible ingenue character pretty well, and looks smashing while doing so. Jamie Dornan, though... In my comments on the first movie, I compared his depth of emotion to a terminator. In this one, he at least attempts some emotional scenes. He doesn't do them very well, but he tries. Supporting cast, especially Marcia Gay Harden, were pretty good, with the exception of Kim Basinger. There is really no reason to see this, except as a continuation of the first movie. It could never stand alone."
FIFTY SHADES DARKER,"Fifty Shades Darker ‚Äì Anastasia Bites her Lip Again Stars Minnesota Johnson as the submissive girlfriend and Jamie Doorknob, as the dominant, controlling boyfriend. This is soft-core porn for girls and I noticed that the screening I attended was almost entirely a female audience. Though be aware that the erotic scenes are not the kind of sex girls want to see or probably enjoy.
 I didn't care about the lead actors, who had very little chemistry in between the sex scenes and even those were pretty dull, the elevator scene is a good example of what I mean.
 The plot is poor, the drama is rubbish, the acting is wooden, and the dialogue is laughable rubbish. The film is unintentionally funny when supposed to be serious, and boring when supposed to be sexy. Although sexier than the original film (my wife tells me) not as graphically sexy as the book. I sat through the pain of this and at the end felt glad I wasn't Christian Grey, though being a billionaire is always very appealing.
 So in summary, this is a rubbish sequel to the original garbage but will do very well because it's been released over the limited window coinciding with the Valentine's period."
FIFTY SHADES DARKER,"Twilight meets American Psycho, minus the good parts. I sat through the last half of 50 shades darker today because my sister was using my Macbook to watch it... Let me sum it up for you:
 Him: ""I'm not good with people because I'm mysterious.""
 Her: ""I like mysterious, but I'm scared cause I'm fragile.""
 Him: ""Don't be afraid, I'm the one who is afraid... of hurting you.""
 *Have Some Sex*
 Her: ""You're so thoughtful, maybe I misjudged you. Now I want to be hurt... just not emotionally.""
 Him: ""I always hurt people, but I would never hurt you... unless you wanted me to.""
 Her: ""Ouch, you hurt me. Now my feelings are hurt and I'm sad and my whole life hurts.""
 Him: ""I'm sorry if I hurt you. I'll try harder, but I don't think I'll ever change.'
 Her: ""I'm gonna pretend like I didn't hear that, but please don't hurt me again. I trust you to change for me- projects are fun.""
 Him: ""Put these things in your ass.""
 Her: ""No."" Him: ""Okay, I'm not good with people because I'm mysterious.""
 *Have Some Sex Again*
 Aaaand Credits"
FIFTY SHADES DARKER,"The worst film I've ever seen While not having particularly high expectations, it must be said, I did go into this film with an open mind. However only a few minutes in and I already felt the urge to leave and fill my brain with something less awful and mind rotting.
 It's not just the non-existent plot and hammy acting that let this film down, although they were major factors, the chemistry between the two leads was like watching two planks of wood getting together. None of what I saw made me believe he was an irresistible sex god with a dark side. And with Ana, let's just say biting ones lip every time something is suggested gets a bit old.
 Furthermore, without wanting to spoil, is her IQ supposed to be about 50? I have to ask because she pretty much agrees to everything he says, and not in a dom/sub kind of way, more just because she doesn't seem to have the mental ability to argue. You have to wonder how she's employed in the first place.
 I've seen some absolutely dire films but I can honestly say this is the worst film I've ever seen."
FIFTY SHADES DARKER,"Watch Psychopath and Plain Jane Date the movie If you are a basic looking chick looking a movie about a rich, hot dude dating a plain chick, then this the movie for you.It doesn't matter whether he is a psychopath, controlling, possessive, dating you because you remind him of his dead mother, and gets off on abusing you. As long as he is rich and good looking, then it's worth it to you and you will enjoy this movie. This movie is designed for you. There is nothing special or interesting about these characters or the one dimensional background cast. You're watching them date for an hour and a half with an vanilla sex scene for every ten to fifteen minutes of talking. There is no conflict or problems in this movie. All the scenes of potential conflicts of the trailer are resolved within minutes after they happen. Anastasia has no backbone in this movie. She gripes and complains about not doing what he wants, then go ahead and do whatever he wants anyway.So if you want to see a movie about Anastasia and Christian date for two hours and have sex, then this is the movie for you.Pros: I liked the first movie because it was so bad it was funny and the soundtrack was good. This movie is literally the two of them getting back together and dating and the soundtrack was okay."
FIFTY SHADES DARKER,Ugh
FIFTY SHADES DARKER,How can a movie that bad exist?
FIFTY SHADES DARKER,"bland Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) has left tycoon Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) who is still obsessed with her. They decide to reignite their affair. She works for a small publisher under demanding boss Jack Hyde. Christian is looking to buy the company. They are being stalked by Christian's former sub Leila. Anastasia is slowly allowed into his family.
 I had low expectations before watching this and I'm not eager for it. It's either a low bar to clear or a preconceived notion. There is a bit of both. Johnson is a perfectly appealing actress but she's not allowed to do much. Dornan continues to be a stiff actor. Despite the promise of the edgy sexual matter, their romance is as boring as heck. Leila could have been a compelling thriller villain but she ends up as a secondary plot. The family drama is hinted at but delivers very little. There's a ridiculously undramatic helicopter crash for very little result. I don't hate this but I just find it boring."
FIFTY SHADES DARKER,"One horrible movie in every aspect This movie is so awful, that it is hard to find words to describe it. I really can't imagine why there are so many people that are willing to go and see in in the cinemas. This movie is not bad, because of the idea for an affair between a rich businessman and a normal girl. It is bad because the dialogues are flat, the characters are terrible and without any depth, there is no actual acting in it, and for the final the story is badly written.
 It is really sad, that such a badly made movies are so popular. They destroy the idea for good movie with acting, script and everything else. And if you expect to see at least a lot of erotic in it, you may fell a bit disappointed at the end. The movie is far from that it promises to its viewers."
FIFTY SHADES DARKER,The first contender on worst movie in 2017
FIFTY SHADES DARKER,"Somehow worse than the first one I hated Fifty Shades Of Grey. Non-sensical, poorly written and painfully dull, there was very little to like about that movie. That's why I'm absolutely baffled that its sequel is even worse. Continuing on from where the original left off with an utterly tedious and ridiculous story, nothing about Fifty Shades Darker grabbed me, whilst it loses any sense of the sleek, or even risky, nature of the first film.
 The main reason that this film is so bad is the story. Featuring consistently incomprehensible twists and turns from start to finish that make an already dull story even less compelling, there was nothing here that got me intrigued in the lives of Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey.
 And whilst the first film was tedious for its almost inactive story, following a weak Anastasia being suppressed by Christian, the fact that the sequel, which does have a modicum of character development, fails to provide any more intrigue or drama is unbelievable. We see Anastasia stronger against Christian, which adds a different dynamic to the relationship, but in turn makes the central focus of the entire series feel irrelevant.
 As a result, we get all these random extra characters flying in and out of the lead duo's lives that are supposed to have some sort of dramatic impact. Almost as inconsequential as some of the scenes from The Room, the new players in this sequel, namely Kim Basinger and Bella Heathcote's characters, appear completely out of the blue, and don't play anywhere near enough of a role to have the intended dramatic effect.
 In short, whilst there's a lot more going on in Fifty Shades Darker than its predecessor, it somehow manages to make everything even more boring. The main relationship is completely stale, the character development is under-utilised, and the new characters turn the film into some sort of weird, nightmarish soap opera that doesn't make one bit of sense.
 Then we move onto the performances. Now, I like Dakota Johnson. She's a perfectly good actress who's put in some great performances over the past few years, but this really isn't one of them. In an almost identical situation to Kristen Stewart in Twilight, Johnson gives a laughably underwhelming performance lumbered by horrific dialogue and a tedious character. She can do a lot better, but she's not able to bring her talents to the table in this film, and that makes her just as poor as everything else in Fifty Shades Darker.
 Alongside Johnson, we have Jamie Dornan. As a character, Christian Grey feels (somehow) even less developed than last time out, and that means that Dornan, whose performance was pretty dull in the first film, doesn't add much to the film at all, coming off as wooden and disinterested as he did before. Meanwhile, the likes of Kim Basinger, Bella Heathcote, Marcia Gay Harden and Eric Johnson, all of whom play in supporting roles, add almost nothing to the story. Again, their characters are as thin as paper, and the dialogue they're given is horrific, but the performances don't do much to rectify those issues.
 Everything I've said so far is the sort of stuff you'd expect from Fifty Shades Darker, especially after the first film. However, what's genuinely disappointing for me about this sequel is how it almost completely loses the best part of the dire original.
 Director Sam Taylor-Johnson left the project after an alleged spate with author of the books, E.L. James. In her place is James Foley, whose directing style just isn't as strong. I genuinely thought that Fifty Shades Of Grey was a well-directed movie. Slick, modern and with a slight air of tension and mystery (even if it was far less risky than you'd expect), there was something about Taylor-Johnson's style that grabbed me.
 Unfortunately, Foley doesn't manage to do the same. Fifty Shades Darker has a little bit of style from time to time, and the directing is still the best part of the movie, but it's a far cry from what we know can be done with this awful story, and with a much duller and less slick visual style, I was even more disappointed with this movie than I ever thought possible.
 Overall, it's pretty clear that Fifty Shades Darker is a horrific film. Somehow worse and more boring than its terrible predecessor, it does nothing to build on the story we saw last time out, instead opting for a soap opera-esque structure full of random characters with completely incomprehensible motives. The performances are bad, the writing is atrocious, and even the directing is poor."
FIFTY SHADES DARKER,We made so much money on a crappy film that we made a part 2 This movie has horrible acting and it's basically nothing but a cheesy cringey chic flick that makes all the single girls that fantasies about having a relationship that is abusive but also stand up for women's rights panties wet. And for the dudes that go watch this..there are so many porn sites that a free and you don't have to sit through hours of bad dialogue for a 15 min soft porn scene. The only reason they keep making these films is because idiots keep buying tickets to go watch this movie. Horrible ratings and people still stand by and defend it. Stop giving a movie high ratings because it increases your hormone levels you horny animals lol
FIFTY SHADES DARKER,"Hard to Say I Love You (RATING: ‚òÜ‚òÜ out of 5)
 GRADE: C-
 THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED
 IN BRIEF: A trashy and laughable sex yawn.
 JIM'S REVIEW: Oh, that privileged 1% ! Those filthy rich beautiful people in their penthouse apartments and spacious mansions, sipping Mo√´t & Chandon and wearing the finest silks and designer leathers. GRRR! But are they happy? Really happy? Let's strip away their false facades...did you say STRIP? Yes, it's time once again for another chapter of the rich and famously good-looking Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and his love slave, Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson), in part two of their pseudo sadomasochistic romance saga...this one entitled Fifty Shades Darker.
 ÔøºThis film steps into the dark side of love once again, or at least that's its soft porn message. Lots of groping, some nudity, very little real passion or sexual tension. In this chapter, He wants back with She, after their previous break-up. He woos and plies her with lavish presents. She accepts his advances with a minimum of resistance as He works his way back into her loins. Sure they have lots of baggage, but their supposedly hot sex is insatiable. The Red Room calls. Bring out the whips, straps, and sexual paraphernalia that can still shock middle America's Puritan values. It's showtime!
 ÔøºDirector James Foley and Niall Leonard (a.k.a. E. L. James' husband) are the responsible parties for this misdemeanor. Let's call Mr. Foley's involvement bad judgment on his part. His direction here is adequate at best. As for our screenwriter, it's nice that the James's try to keep it in the family, but unleashing this trash to the general public should be a criminal act.
 Fifty Shades Darker wants to be soft core sex fantasy, melodramatic soap opera, and, in this second chapter, a mystery thriller. The wafer-thin plot (although there is one this time) involves spurned former lovers, unhinged stalkers, and lecherous bosses with questionable intentions. But all the movie becomes is a hilarious comedy of errors (mostly due to the cast and filmmakers). It's a real mess, destined for most critic's worst film list of 2017...including mine.
 ÔøºThe dialog is unintentionally funny, the characters cardboard silly, and the plot absurd.
 For example, here are some of the verbal exchanges:
 ""I don't know whether to worship at your feet or spank you."" ""Okay, fine. I will have dinner with you because I am hungry."" ""You're not sticking those up my butt.""
 Shakespeare needn't worry.
 The most well defined part of this drool is Mr. Dornan's abs which get quite a workout. His character lacks any dimension unless erect (and that is never shown and only intimated, of course). As for Ms. Johnson, her ample cleavage and perky breasts share equal screen time and should have star billing status as well. The actress establishes her character as a series of girlish pouts, wide-eyed ogling, and sensual lip-biting. Both performers are more silly than sexy. These physical fit actors have done better work in other films, but they did choose fame and an almighty fat check for their involvement in this series, so the blame is partially theirs as well as the filmmakers. However, I will credit them with some some acting restraint in delivering the banal dialog with the straightest of poker faces. That must have been the only thing hard on the set. Ôøº Bad acting is also prevalent in the supporting cast of characters. Two Oscar winning actresses, Marcia Gay Harden and Kim Basinger should have known better. Up and coming actors like Eric Johnson, Bella Heathcote, Rita Ora, and Luke Grimes bring some class to their classless roles. All go the soap opera route, lots of hysteria and excess.
 In fact, there are so many ripe displays of excesses, definitely the fault of a woeful script: many stagy sex romps that register 1 on the hot meter, especially that classic steamy shower scene, an elevator tryst that is more laughable than sensual, and a rather silly set piece involving a Venetian styled masquerade ball that is reminiscent of Kubrick's only dud, Eyes Wide Shut, (which is the best advice one can give to viewing this movie, although it is the filmmakers who should really hide.) Ôøº Fifty Shades Darker is dim indeed. Still planning to take your significant other to this awful movie? Perhaps then I might suggest a ""safe word"" for all film lovers: AVOID!"
FIFTY SHADES DARKER,"Although the first movie was awful, the sequel was okish but was poor enough at the same time.."
FIFTY SHADES DARKER,"Cheap fairy tale for girls with daddy issues My God, Where to begin? this movie was awful in so many ways that make a list would be such a waste of time. Anyway, I can mention the most prominent and substantial to me, starting by the most elementary piece which is the idea behind the whole story, in other words the subtext or message that the film delivers. This is no other thing but a teenager wet dream, founded on the most shameless shallowness and superficiality: Is the story of a naive young girl obsessed with the actual prototype of perfect spouse in every aspect important for the society, millionaire, handsome, fit, hard-sex addict, possessive and tough guy, so tough that he even resists an helicopter crash to come back without a scratch; so basically what the movie tries to unfold it's an attempt to tell a story where this girl keeps striving to catch this guy and engage him into a ""serious relationship"" without all of his flaws and addictions, in this process all of his evil ex's and spooky characters of his past will try to stop her in such predictable manners that you will have to throw some popcorn to others in theater to get amused if possible.
 This links to the second aspect to bring up: The Script. This script is so dull and predictable that you would regret buying your ticket in the first 15 min, it's so dummy and felts so unreal that in some point gets laughable, the characters and dialogues are so shallow and the plot twists are far more predictable than fast and furious or any bad horror movie. Linked to that the actors don't help too much, it could be enough with that script but no, the director and producers want you to suffer in every possible way, they throw you a complete platter of mediocrity performances, overacted and fictitious, filled with nonsensical dialogues and cheap jokes.
 In the technical aspect there's no much to say, it's another big studio fail, a nearly invisible treatment in the visual camp, mediocre photography, sound mixing and editing which is refilled with pop music to solve the problem.
 In conclusion, 50 Shades Darker it's the perfect opportunity to get your daughter most desired obsessions emerged, or even your girlfriend can connect to the cheap-fake fairy tale of sex and passion this movie delivers."
FIFTY SHADES DARKER,Manages to be worse than the first one
FIFTY SHADES DARKER,"Masochism Offered To Us By Sadists ""Hey Theo , what's a young good looking boy like you doing sitting alone watching films on Valentines day ? You should be taking a beautiful woman out on a romantic date ""
 Well thanks for the concern but I really do think Christopher Hitchens summed up the long term sexual relationship perfectly by the soundbite ""Now this is masochism - but it's being offered to you by sadists"" . The Hitch was of course referring to religion but both religion and the long term sexual relationship have an identical definition . I'm also reminded of how Albert Einstein described idiocy:""Doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result"" . In the case of the 50 SHADES narrative we're subjected to idiotic masochism
 If you've seen the first film you'll be entirely puzzled as to the casting because I don't think I've seen an actor and actress so badly cast in a film where the whole concept of the story revolves around sexual attraction . Both Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson are two actors best suited for lead roles in a bland daytime soap opera . Let's remind ourselves Christian Grey is a multi billionaire oozing in Byronic sexuality while Ana Steele is , or rather was a na√Øve young woman embarking on an intensely mind blowing sexual relationship with Grey and the casting really does not work . In fact several sexually charged scenes are unintentionally funny and will cause howls of laughter as the two leads spout their lines before engaging in sex . Add to this as a possible love rival in the form of Jack Hyde as played by Eric Johnson and you've got a hat trick of actors with the sexual charisma of drowned haddock . Casting Kim Basinger in a small role makes things worse because you're reminded of her on screen chemistry with Mickey Rourke in 91/2 WEEKS which while not being a great film did have an erotic quality to it and despite some fairly explicit sex scenes for a mainstream Hollywood movie in 50 SHADES DARKER it's fairly devoid of erotica"
FIFTY SHADES DARKER,"And we're back, yet again. Two years ago, when I saw Fifty Shades of Grey, I knew this day would come, looming, like a dark, boring cloud on the horizon.
 If, for some strange and grotesque, you happened to enjoy the first movie, you'll like this one. If you are everyone else on the face the planet, yeah, it's just more of the same boring who-hockey that we've seen before. There is very little to like about this film.
 The good: Like the first movie, it's a slickly crafted movie with good aesthetics and a rad soundtrack..... Yeah, that's pretty much it.
 The good news is that it holds pretty close to the source material, the bad news is that it's almost as though the source material is bad Twilight fan fiction that some chick wrote on the notepad app on her iPhone....., oh wait, that's exactly what it is. I sh¬ï¬ï you not.
 This really isn't good. It makes less sense than anything I've seen in a long, long time.
 I cannot, in good conscience, recommend that you watch this under any circumstance."
FIFTY SHADES DARKER,"Awful. Horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!! This is the worse film I've ever seen, the original is the second worse. It's a 2 hour bore fest where nothing happens. This film is full of random sex scenes with no reason of being there. This could only appeal to women who want to see something they would find arousing. The plot can be summarized in a few line, which i won't do to make this spoiler free. If you have any appreciation for films avoid! Do not support this disgusting attempt to be an entertaining piece of fiction!"
FIFTY SHADES DARKER,"More like 'Fifty Shades Greyer' Hopefully, as a heterosexual female student in her twenties with a love of film that spreads across all genres and decades, this will come over as a fair assessment of a film that genuinely did nothing for me.
 Like as was said in my review for 'Fifty Shades of Grey', have not read the books, though have heard conflicting opinions that has mostly been intense dislike. The reason for watching 'Fifty Shades Darker' was not due to wanting to hate on it, being a negative person, curiosity but for the reason of being at a film night with friends (who liked the books) recently and 'Fifty Shades Darker', like with 'Fifty Shades of Grey', happened to be the film choice. Just for the record, the general consensus ranged from indifference to hating it with a passion.
 'Fifty Shades Darker' is a small improvement over its predecessor but not by much. The flaws are still the same but it's not as quite as near-irredeemably bad, and it at least tries to give some raunchy edge while not exactly succeeding.
 Once again, the beguiling soundtrack, that has a soothing nostalgia and appropriately amorous quality, is the best thing about it. It also looks good, nice use of scenery and very nicely shot. There is one acting bright spot, which is Marcia Gay Harden who does very well with her role.
 However, the same flaws are all here. Like 'Fifty Shades of Grey', Danny Elfman's score is one-note and repetitive, as well as too derivative of his recent work. He has composed some wonderful stuff ('Edward Scissorhands' is magical) but this is really not his best work. Despite the change of director, the directing style feels too mannered and there is a real sense that the director was ill-suited to material that is beneath him, after all he's done stuff like 'House of Cards' and 'Glengarry Glenn Ross'.
 The rest of the supporting cast fail to stand out, with Kim Basinger having little to do, next to nothing actually. More problematic once more are the two leads, and the chemistry is next to zero once more. Understated can be a lovely quality to acting, as long as it also becomes nuanced and with believability given to the dialogue. Dakota Johnson, especially in the first third, is too understated that it feels more like there is a lack of personality or emotion. Jamie Dornan looks uncomfortable throughout, delivers his cringe-worthy lines awkwardly and is just bland as dishwater with no charisma whatsoever. Chemistry is non-existent.
 Again, the dialogue does no favours, dialogue so bad that absolutely nobody (even the best actors and actresses) can do anything with it. It causes unintentional laughter throughout, is embarrassingly clunky and is pure smut. Then there is the story that is so thin structurally, heavy in repetition, so badly plodding and without style or atmosphere that the film feels twice as long. Even with attempts to give more raunchiness and kinkiness, as well as edge, none of it comes over naturally, feeling horribly contrived. The rest of it is done far too tamely and the BDSM portrayal is still deceitful. The characters are little more than ciphers.
 Overall, a small improvement but still pretty dreadful even when giving it a fair chance. 2/10 Bethany Cox"
FIFTY SHADES DARKER,"Why all the 1's?! You know what you're going to get when you watch this so why all the low ratings? It was never going to win an Oscar. It's a decent watch and I quite like watching how their relationship develops over the three films. It's easy watching and whilst I agree he can be a bit wooden at times, I think that's the point of his character. He's not comfortable with emotion! I think it's an easy watching love story and shows how two people develop and compromise when they love each other. Yes, it will never win awards but it is enjoyable. And for the record, I never read the books until years after they came out. I'm not a die hard fan of them at all as found them quite repetitive, but I did enjoy the films."
FIFTY SHADES DARKER,Makes you laugh more than an average comedy
FIFTY SHADES DARKER,"Predictable plotting The predictable plotting and the boring dialogues makes this sequel automatically uninteresting. ""Fifty Shades Darker"" is worst than the first movie because the characters have learned nothing and repeat the exact same unhealthy relationship. The two beautiful protagonists do their bests to treating sex like a pleasurable activity but is not enough and the result is not good. The thriller narrative, involving persons from Grey's strange past, exposes the shallowness of the story. What made the first unit of this trilogy so much better than the current version is that everything was then new. But now that we are familiar with the equipment in Christian's lavish penthouse, the novelty is gone and the boredom is here."
FIFTY SHADES DARKER,"Oh its so bad terrible one of my biggest guilty pleasures of All time Its so bad it is good Alright the shitty major guilty pleasure franchise based on the shitty twilight fan fiction continues so will it be better or worst than the first one or what? Thats what we will know right now ,firstly it was way way way worst than the 1st one,i wanted to see it at the cinema cause it could be deleted version but in did see it both cinema and leaked version so i said why not specially the director i love his movies so i had some hopes that they could learn from the mistakes but they made it worst the acting was way way way worst even Dakota Johnson she looks great Jarmie Dornan is right in loving her but she was worst than the first one although Grey's pleasures or his bad way in treating her was not harsh as the first one but still his acting was like a falsehood acting even the soundtrack that the first one was perfect at,this one's music was bad only countable songs were good even the sex scenes itself one in the beginnings of the movie wasn't made right but the rest were realistic again because they edited some music its not NC-17 if it was NC17 movie i would've said its great one but no, i just liked the chemistry between them but porn watchers will say its a good one but I'm not a porn watcher I'm saying its a guilty pleasure cause its laughably bad it is good and i could enjoy it without making it a good one again another shitty soft core porn feature film my rating is its not horseshit its triple horseshit or horseshit to the power of 10üòÇ that's why my score is 1/10"
FIFTY SHADES DARKER,A boring sequel of a dumb romance
AFTER,"SUPER CRINGY. Almost painful to sit through. Story could be condensed into a minute long, bad dialog spaced out with awful montages. Predictable and very very very cringy."
AFTER,Cringy. Worst love story ever.
AFTER,"STOP Romanticizing Toxic Relationships! The fact that this movie won 3 Teen Choice Awards is seriously disturbing. Is this the kind of movie we want to promote to the female teen audience? Bad boy just needs a good woman to tame him. NO! This is a toxic relationship, and we need to stop promoting it! So many teen movies have this at the core and it's sending the wrong message. This is not what a good and healthy relationship looks like. This is what you RUN from. Ladies, you're not responsible for ""fixing"" a man."
AFTER,I've a headache The teen angst is so over played and corney. My eyes hurt and my ears are needing from the corn fest. Normally I'd like abit if corniness but this is beyond what I'd tolerate.
AFTER,If you love Twilight and She's All That with a toned down Fifty shades of grey then this is it
AFTER,Preedicable and boring. Just another typical run of the mill love story. This could have been played out as another Nicolas Sparks novel but it wasn't even up to par with his standard.
AFTER,Spoiler - Girl cheats and netflix wants you to love it What is this world coming to. Why would you promote such garbage. Stupid movie I could have done without.
AFTER,"This was actually painful to watch I cringed every 5 seconds most forced writing and interactions I've ever seen in my life It will literally make no sense to anyone who's never read the novels, you'll want to gauche your eyes out"
AFTER,"Lame, lame and more lame."
AFTER,"Formula to the Nth Degree Always, always a sign of cheap production/script is opening scene w/overhead view of car traveling on roadway. Furthering the formula, for our single mom's daughter being sent off to college, is the dorm scene meeting of her new roomie who of course is the polar opposite of our nice bookish daughter - duh!. Then comes the all too obvious being coaxed into a party instead of studying. Usual redux countless times scenario of alcohol, and girl meets guy which leads to problems & obvious resolution. Classroom scenes were totally fake, e.g. our two lovers arguing an interpretation of a bit of classical lit. Discord w/mom over her independence to do dumb things - predictable. To sell this story our producers only used model looks' actors."
AFTER,"A waste of film Slow, boring and predictable, it's a complete waste of time."
AFTER,"Save your money for something worth! I went to see this film with my hopes high since I have read the books multiple times and I absolutely loved them. Well, I got really disappointed. If you have read the books, you're going to be really disappointed as well. If you haven't, you will not understand the story, since the action is overall really quick, so you don't really understand the scenes or why they are even there. It is boring because 90% of the film nothing much different happens, most of the times is just music playing and Tessa and Hardin kissing and making out. The dialogues are weak, they barely even talk, and if they do, is just hi and how are you. Basically, the characters met and 5 seconds later are already declaring eternal love. No sense at all. The storyline is poor and doesn't respect the film at all. For me, the film killed the book. I feel like the characters didn't show much emotion. Hardin I just didn't feel the vibe. He is really superficial and his personality is just neutral.
 PLEASE GO SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO WATCH SOMETHING BETTER"
AFTER,"I wasted 2 hrs that I could have used to drink paint. Holy crap this was the most garbage cliche movie ever. The main character Tessa who is not like other girls bc i study meets Hardin who is a bad boy but he like literature and is really rapey like really. The acting is dry and worse than aNY porno I have ever seen. If u want to watch this i suggest you watch 50 shades instead because at least it's graphic enough to distract you from the garbage plot. The plot was so bad and all the ""dramatic"" part made me and my friends laugh so hard. We laughed at a lot of inappropriate times like I could sense those angsty teen girl glares. This was a waste of money and time and I would rather bang my head against the wall for 2 hrs than watch it again. I would rather get lead poisoning from drinking paint and then proceed to drink a puddle in the parking lot of a taco bell."
AFTER,"flat soap Tessa Young (Josephine Langford) is a good girl. She is starting college and her simpleton boyfriend is still in high school. Her mother (Selma Blair) hates her new roommates. She is pulled into their party world and the mysterious bad boy Hardin Scott (Hero Fiennes Tiffin).
 Langford is a beautiful girl but I would give her glasses to fit the role. Hardin is such a smirking British douche that it's impossible to root for this relationship. It's cringe-worthy how much I dread this movie going forward. The only meet-cute moment comes from the Great Gatsby difference. He needs to dial down the hipster vibe and dial up the bad boy personality. Her high school boyfriend isn't much better either and bookish Landon has no juice. Dread is the defining word for this movie. I'm guessing that this is 50 Shades for teen girls. It's just as bad. The plot is slower than molasses and obvious as F. The dialogue is clunkier than a Ford Pinto but this movie has no possibility of exploding. The breakdown of Jane Austen is simplistic and too broad while trying to be deeply literary. That's part of the clunky dialogue conundrum. It needs to be smart and it tries to absorb the smarts by commandeering literary classics. It fails the comparison. It would be smarter to debate the romantic possibilities of Fuller House. At least, it would be at its own level. With Langford and Tiffin, the movie has two models right out of a catalog. They are unable to deliver more dimensions to these characters. There are way too many montages although the aquarium looks great. This is indeed 50 Shades for teen girls."
AFTER,"Awful storyline, awful acting Are we just going to ignore the fact that this story was originally a Harry styles smut????? Lmaooo"
AFTER,"An ersatz of Rebel without a cause First things first, I clearly do not belong to the intended audience which is probably narrowed to female and romantic teens, between 11 and 15 years old. Possibly older, with a touch of nostalgia. Tessa, an ingenuous teen, leaves home, mum and high school in order to integrate university, her roommate inviting her to join an idle and carefree group. She meets there Hardin, a rebel without a cause (Nicholas Ray, 1956) but with a keen interest in literature, like herself. The continuation is relatively predictable and indubitably goofy. My own rating: 2/3 out of 10. My rating while trying to belong to the intended audience, with a generous empathy boosted to the extreme: 4/5 out of 10."
AFTER,"Disappointing Two people meet in college, fall in love very fast and then for the rest of the movie you watch them making out. The ""plot twist"" isn't even a twist. The book(s) are incredibly gripping, I don't understand why they had to tone the plot down this much. The movie should have been 18+, it feels like it's 12-."
AFTER,"Pretty standard story, worth a watch for Josephine Langford."
AFTER,"Come on, it was not that bad. ""The Great Gatsby, it's a good book."" That is how stereotypical 'After' gets. (AND that statement is so not true.) However, it's a good mix of clich√©. It still works: romantic vibes, fluttering heart, and sexual chemistry between a couple. Amplified sound of touching skin escalates passionate and erotic emotions of viewers. Most importantly (in romance films), chemistry is there between two actors. I want to compliment Langford and Tiffin on their decent performance as leading roles for the first time."
AFTER,Josephine is the sweetest girl i have seen in years Josephine the girl who plays the lead role is the main reason to watch this average romantic drama which without Josephine would be boring as hell if u exclude last half an hour or so but Josephine and her chemistry with the the guy who played the other main role makes this movie worth of your time. thank god we finally got something worth of a scenario twist in last 20 minutes and the movie ended strong but at the end Josephine is the reason to watch this film.
AFTER,What a slog I watched the whole thing! Hard to believe all the 9 and 10 stars for this slog of a film. I kept waiting for something meaningful. Never happened!
AFTER,"Worse than Twilight or 50 Shades of Grey I cringed everytime i watched Hardin and Tessa and their lines got me on my nerves so much. They take minutes to start talking and when they do it, they dont say anything relavant or logic and it sounds wrong. They do act like children or even worse. Hardin is a wannabe trying to be creep, stalker, he's a baby boy, like grow up dude. The only issue with him happened when he was 8 years old like along time. Everyone has their traumatic experiences or stories. He's not even a victim of verbal or physical abuse from his family and he acts like his life is the worst... He isn't even seen like a dangerous bad boy how the book portray him. Bad boys are strong, not a whiny baby... He's just an immature jerk and she is a disloyal girlfriend. I don't even understand how her boyfriend wasn't mad at her for betrayal. for accepting to be cheated on. I guess he was really tired of her. That or he had a girlfriend secretly too. There is much i would say but i'm not even bothering my time. This movie sucks ass , bad message."
AFTER,"Waste of time... ""After"" is a Drama - Romance movie in which we watch a young woman falling in love with a young man who is very complicated because of his dark past and some choices he has done. They both have to find out how they can work things out in order to be together.
 I did not have high expectations from this movie and that is the main reason I was not disappointed. This movie has a poor and boring plot, without any plot twists or surprises to make it even a little bit interesting and it's mainly consists of major clich√©s. The interpretations of the cast followed the same pattern of the plot and direction, and they were below average. Finally, I have to say that I have not read any of the books and I only take into my consideration the movie which I found dreadful and I believe that I wasted my time watching it, I do not recommend it to anyone."
AFTER,"One of the worst ""romances"" I have ever seen After is a 2019 film directed by Jenny Gage and starring Josephine Langford, Hero Fiennes Tiffin and Khadijha Red Thunder.
 Never have I been so bored and uninterested by a film since I watched 1998's The Avengers, this film sucks.
 I don't even know where to start, it's so awfull in so many ways, the acting is either bland or bad, and the characters are everything but likeable, I haven't had to follow characters that I dislike so much like in this film in a long time, the only ones that I actually like are Landon and maybe Noah.
 The story is almost as clich√© as it gets the dialogue is cringe worthy but I will say that I do think the film is well shot and looks pretty good most of the time however that is simply not enough to save it, not even close. 3/10"
AFTER,Slow and Boring I was looking forward to watching this movie. Hoping that this movie would have a great twist. But it never happened like the trailer promised. I would recommend this movie if you can't sleep. Their is zero energy and horrible directing. I couldn't find one good seen in this entire movie...
WONDER WOMAN 1984,"So bad that I almost walked out of my own house! The first one was fun and well played out. This sequel is a total misfire. Not because it follows the trend of having women being the alpha characters and portraying men as either weak or stupid, but simply because it's a lazy effort. Except a couple of scenes, and hilarious over-the-top acting by Pedro Pascal, I found nothing here. It has ""straight-to-DVD"" written all over it."
WONDER WOMAN 1984,Surprisingly poor
WONDER WOMAN 1984,"Ouch, that was so boring. The first film is outstanding, it's exciting, it's fun, and apart from looking amazing, it has depth.
 The problem here, it's so slow, and goes on forever and a day, did anything actually happen in the first ninety minutes? There was absolutely no action.
 Chris Pine felt wrong here somehow, eye candy only, Gal Gadot, I thought she was pretty good, the shining light here, I just felt like she was battling against a miserable script. You could almost sense that she knew the script was no good.
 The Villains were generally inept.
 I won't be watching again, 3/10."
WONDER WOMAN 1984,Be careful what you wish for.
WONDER WOMAN 1984,Utter disappointment
WONDER WOMAN 1984,Horrendous
WONDER WOMAN 1984,Whoever wrote this did not live through the Cold War or the 80s
WONDER WOMAN 1984,"What a wasted opportunity This movie has some really bad points. It isn't the worst action hero movie ever. It's 80% bad with some redeeming qualities here and there. Firstly the bad points: 1. The story. This silly ""wish"" premise is weak and wears thin very fast. Be careful for what you wish for. Even a 1984 movie wouldn't have such a simplistic premise. It gets too overblown at the end. The writers really did a bad job. It's beyond low mentality and cliched. And things really fizzle out at the climax. 2. Long winded scenes. Many scenes could have been cut in half to keep the momentum going. From the overlong competition in the beginning, almost every scene could have been trimmed by a quarter. The good points: 1. Gal Gadot is watchable and likeable - she could read the phone book and it would be watchable. 2. Pedro Pascal of Narcos is the villain here and he looks quite different - good that he has a big movie role. 3. Kristen Wiig has a remarkable transformation and her character is quite interesting. 4. Watch out for Lynda Carter. The cast is good but they can't save a bad story. Chris Pine looks a bit haggard. 5. The production values are fine - it is a big budget movie. And the cinematography is good.
 They had better think carefully about who they get to make Part 3."
WONDER WOMAN 1984,"Actionhero movie with almost no action Writer, producer and director Patty Jenkins really did a give this movie a feminine/soap opera touch and by doing so destroyed everything that this movie could have been. The first WW movie was not that great, but Patty did not write that one, this sequel she did and it is worthless. I was wondering if I was watching a drama or a action hero franchise. First the movie is far to long, the dialogue's are pointless and boring, you can skip with ease them because the story is not that complicated. For the action, the effects are good, not worth the time to watch, but still well made, but there are not very much action scenes. If you look at the demographic of the votes you can see girls <18 years are the only ones who love this movie, and that should have been the warning that should have been given with this movie: only see this movie if you are a teenage girl."
WONDER WOMAN 1984,Absolute Chaos.
WONDER WOMAN 1984,"WW84 This one they should have left in 1984, or even 1884 I recently had the pleasure, or what it a displeasure, either way I sat thru watching this trash and wondered when in hell it would all end, 2 hours and 31 minutes later in creeped to an end, but wait, in the end, the Easter Egg, made this horrible, terrible movie a littles less trashy.
 Since IMDb hate spoiler in their reviews, I won't spoil it, but let me say, if this is the future of the next Wonder Woman, there are good things coming down the pike, cause right now, this movie is a heaping pile of ... wasted film.
 Just because a woman or women want to produce and direct major films doesn't always mean they should, in this case they really shouldn't have, their vision for WW stunk to high heaven, please take away whatever they are writing with and burn it.
 The sad thing about this is they brought back from the dead a guy who blew up in a plane in 1942 or thereabouts, then tried poorly to explain it away. Having grown up and lived in 1984, whoever the set designer was, must have lived in an alternate reality, I'm guessing Trumplandia, it was nothing like the real 1984.
 So, if you are reading this prior watching the movie, save yourself a lot of time and don't , you'll have more fun watching rust form on metal."
WONDER WOMAN 1984,"WW84 is a joke, but it's a fun one. WW84 is entertaining, but unfortunately not as good as other DC films (or generally films of the superhero genre).
 Storyline: Set in 1984, Wonder Woman tries to save the world once again from an unlikely enemy while she still seems to be thinking about Chris Pine.
 Runtime stands at 2,5h which is too long but the pace of the film is good.
 CGI is good throughout the movie and most the action scenes are well made. There's a bunch of great outtakes as well.
 The cast is interesting-Pedro Pascal's overacting is a highlight- and Gal Gadot is stunning once again. Kirsten Wiig is also a good addition to the film, but the development of her character could have been more in depth so we can see her transformation being more justified.
 On the contrary, the character of Pedro Pascal is well developed and I was impressed by the tension that he adds in the entire film. I was happy to see him switching between drama and comedy and many points go to him for keeping the film's pace interesting.
 But the film lacks a strong villain and the performance of Gal was a bit dry.
 Overall, it's a fun Sunday afternoon superhero flick which should have been 30 min shorter.
 6,9/10."
WONDER WOMAN 1984,"An overly long movie with a half-baked plot, covered in bright & colorful frosting Wonder Woman's powers have been pretty unclear in the DCEU thus far, and this movie didn't help things. In fact, Wonder Woman 1984 kind of makes up abilities for everyone just to further the plot. Plus, the characters don't really talk to each other, they just all seem to be trying to dispense profound fortune cookie messages about truth, hope, and desire. This is a messy, overly long movie with a half-baked plot that's covered in bright & colorful 80s-themed frosting."
WONDER WOMAN 1984,Way too much to say
WONDER WOMAN 1984,"Dumb!! 1. Background of WW youth story seemed very artificially seen-before-unlikely. Not creative or interesting.
 2. A quartz crystal prop (also seen many times in movies) that you can purchase on line or in many gift shops for ballpark $10 to $20; instantly materializes wishes - please, so juvenile dumb.
 3. Action scenes such as the as usual vehicle chase was a boring redux from nearly every action movie. Nothing new.
 4. Magical lasso scenes came across as very cheap CGI.
 5. If anything the movie's intent was to showcase Gadot's looks."
WONDER WOMAN 1984,"Believe the negative reviews Wonder Woman is not wonderful.
 This wasn't the horrible movie some reviewers make it out to be. 1 & 2 stars is a bit exaggerated-- I save such ratings for worst of the worst. At the worst this is simply a disappointing, poorly-written, badly-directed comic-book movie (emphasis on comic book writing... and there have been better comic books).
 Still, believe the negativity. This movie has so very many flaws. I'll sum the entire movie up in one scene: roping a lightning bolt and swinging from it.
 Seriously?
 WW'84 made me feel like I was watching the 1970s Wonder Woman with all its ridiculous camp. With almost 2000 reviews here I don't need to spend a lot of time writing this one. A bunch of people are going to see this movie. Some are going to love it because well... that's some people. Some people will like it because of Gadot or Pine. A whole lot more are gonna be justifiably disappointed.
 There are worse movies out there. Wonder Woman is bad, but remember Batman and Robin? Electra? Catwoman? Some movie writers and directors need a lot more talent."
WONDER WOMAN 1984,Long and Boring .
WONDER WOMAN 1984,Wonder Woman 1984 is... A Wasted Concept.
WONDER WOMAN 1984,"Even Big Brother isn't watching this The year is 1984. For some reason. Diana(Gadot, asked to carry a lot of the movie on her shoulders, and, sadly for all of us, out of her depth) still misses Steve Trevor(Pine, charming as ever, given less to do than last time). You'd think she misses her people, family, home country, more than the guy she knew for a week 66 years ago, but whatever. One day, he mysteriously returns. And a number of people are having wishes granted. Can something like that happen without serious consequences? And is it possible to include a moral message about that, without getting extremely condescending?
 This is a mess. While I wish it was significantly better, I won't let my disappointment affect this review, I will be entirely honest. The tone is again partially that of the Christopher Reeves(RIP) Superman movies, especially the first two, except for when it's gritty and harsh. Those two approaches clash. A lot of the acting is reminiscent of the Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies, which works a lot of the time there, yet rarely here. The storytelling is sloppy, with countless instances of people somehow guessing where to go(and what to do, and what is happening), superpowers with inconsistent rules and sometimes lasting only one seem never to be mentioned before or after. It seems as though the Golden Lasso can do absolutely anything that they felt like it could at that moment. You have to look pretty hard to find a bigger fan of Patty Jenkins than me. I've watched Monster over two dozen times, before the release of Birds of Prey the first Wonder Woman solo movie was easily my favourite DCEU entry, and honestly I do still think she has more amazing movies in her. I don't think the blame lies entirely on her for the low quality of this film. It appears to me that it was butchered in the editing room, with the unusually long post production allowing for way too many producer notes, as studio people got cold feet about certain aspects of this. That would explain why so many things in this are poorly set up and/or go unresolved.
 This features disturbing material. I recommend it only to the biggest fans of the people who made it. 4/10."
WONDER WOMAN 1984,Makes Justice League and Suicide Squad look Oscar worthy
WONDER WOMAN 1984,"In quarantine, you'll buy anything. Very colorful, lots of money spent. Kristin Wiig was a masterpiece of miscasting. She wasn't funny; she wasn't scary, but great costume. The whole plot was a vehicle to resurrect Chris Pine, but there was no real chemistry between them. It made the lines of endearment quite awkward and the embraces seemed forced. All the usual tropes: WW loses some of her powers, so there can be suspense; she plays Spiderman and holds two vehicles apart. Just nothing new and Gad Gadot proves again that she's a glamour model and poses well. She can't act. Still - entertainment in a vacuum of good movies, so watch it and be distracted for TWO AND A HALF hours."
WONDER WOMAN 1984,"A Bland, Banal & Bloated Mess"
WONDER WOMAN 1984,"Just read the other review. All true! Why is Warner Brothers hell bent on destroying a potential gold mine, that is the DC franchise. I thought they had finally sorted it with WW and Aquaman. But no, normality resumes. This movie was terrible at everything. Story, dialogue, acting, cgi. Just sell the franchise to another studio and give us DC fans a break"
WONDER WOMAN 1984,Doesn't have the powerful touch as before
WONDER WOMAN 1984,Wonder Woman 1984: The Quest For Peace. Awful.
STRANGE WORLD,"The film is a bit unfocused... ... and while I think they did a great job building a world, with a lot of cool recombinations of old sci-fi concepts, the actual characters don't feel at all well sketched out and the themes and plot are remarkably thin. Like it's an okay film but it's a bit below the normal standards of Disney Animation.
 The dialogue is definitely too much on the nose, and it feels pitched a little too young for what they're going for.
 The main character arc of the movie is reminiscent of (and far inferior to) Mitchells vs The Machines to me, which can't be a great help. Not saying that there can only be one ""quirky teen has strained relationship with father"" movie but it's definitely a detriment when I'm thinking about a film that does that much better and with a whole lot more emotional complexity and heart while watching this.
 Also, does anyone else feel like the sheer quantity of movies that are coming out right now that are about intergenerational trauma is getting a bit tiresome?
 The environmental message is fine, but honestly it's mildly horrifying how culturally we're already at the point where kids movies are pitching ""you should be willing to accept a much lower standard of living to save the planet."" Not totally this movies fault, but that is where we are.
 The opening sequence is really nice though, I'll say that."
STRANGE WORLD,"Strangely Mediocre World Ehhh pretty generic and meh. Didn't feel much for the characters emotionally and the movie wasn't that funny. The Strange World stuff wasn't really anything I hadn't already seen before. Where the plot goes at the end thinks it's more clever than it actually is. I was underwhelmed by the entire execution.
 At the end of the day, this is very weak by Modern Disney standards. It's an easy watch and the animation is decent in places, as well as the music, but overall I'm not going to remember much from it that I had already seen these premises/concepts done in movies before. A Mediocre World is what it is.
 5/10."
STRANGE WORLD,"Definitely not a typical Disney. I'd categorise this as a B movie, as in one that should've just been released on a streaming platform or straight to budget dvd. It's not particularly bad but it's a huge drop off in the quality you expect from them.
 The characters are not ones you'll remember or think about again, they tried for a stereotypical cute one but that was wide of the mark. They handled the same sex relationship in the most natural non forced way so props for that and the inclusion of the 3 legged dog was sweet.
 It was a strange plot, beautifully animated and designed but it felt like it was trying to say something but couldn't work out exactly what it was, it's too dull for small kids and not engaging for adults so maybe 9-13 sorta age?"
STRANGE WORLD,"Strange World The last fifteen minutes or so do redeem this to a certain extent, but otherwise it is a curiously disjointed story that seems drawn from ""Island at the Top of the World"" (1974) with bits of ""Journey to the Centre of the Earth"" (1959) and ""The Lost World"" (1960) thrown in for good measure. We start with the legendary explorer ""Jaeger Clade"" who is determined to find a way past the enclosing mountain peaks of their community. Like many a father, he drags along his unwilling son and when things come to an head, he proceeds alone leaving the younger man ""Searcher"" with his newly discovered crop of radioactive Brussels sprouts. Twenty-five years pass, and he has now grown up and successfully developed a farm of these particularly useful vegetables. He even has his own statue! Suddenly, though, the plants start to die and it falls to him and his own young son ""Ethan"" to embark on a perilous mission to the heart of the plant's root system and save it before it dies. These escapades are nicely and creatively animated with some fun to be had along the way, but there is simply too much sentiment, familial discord and cheesy dialogue to sustain this - as well as a dog that really annoys after a while. The characterisations are really undercooked and just about every box you can imagine is ticked as the story ultimately concludes with a bit of a nod to Oriental mythology. It is certainly watchable, but there is no need to shell out on a cinema ticket for it. Disney+ will do fine in due course when you can safely leave the kids to watch."
STRANGE WORLD,"Not-So-Bad World I honestly don't get all the hate for this movie, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's definitely not fantastic but it's not terrible neither, it's a better effort from Disney compared to recent outings. Yes the characters aren't as well developed as they could have been, the story is just a rehash of everything that's been done before, the ideas don't really go anywhere, and certain situations just conveniently resolve themselves without much effort. But what did you expect from Disney these days? Just turn off your brain and keep expectations low and you'll find there's a lot to like; I love the Star Trek vibe, the creatures in the strange world were pretty cool, the blue blob was a lot of fun, the three-legged dog was awesome, I'm not sure why he was there and why he had to be three-legged but what the heck, he's a good boy! Just like the movie, it's flawed and you're not sure why it's there, but it's enjoyable."
STRANGE WORLD,"Boring! We went expecting a great Disney movie especially using 3D. Instead we found plot to be boring and effects of 3D ineffective. You know a movie is bad when your grandkids are asking to leave because they're bored. We were all Very disappointed. It was supposed to be an enjoyable Thanksgiving tradition to see a fun, adventurous Disney movie. Unfortunately, it just couldn't keep any of our family member's attention. I am hopeful that the next one will have a real plot that an 11 year old cannot already determine what's going to happen. On the plus side, the colors were vivid and the Splat character was cute."
STRANGE WORLD,"Jaeger Bomb Interesting. A bit of a self-fulfilment by Disney here, in my opinion. ""Strange World"" has flopped quite badly at the box office, mostly I suspect due to a lack of promotion - the film was in the cinema before I'd even heard of it. You have to wonder though if that lack of promotion was because the company lost faith with a movie that struggles to shake off the idea that it's all a bit second rate.
 Searcher Clade (Jake Gyllenhaal), son of the legendary explorer Jaeger Clade (Dennis Quaid) returns from an aborted expedition without his father, who continues on alone, but with a mysterious plant that can generate electricity. Decades later, with Searcher now a husband and father, he's tasked with another expedition, to work out why his miracle discovery is started to die. His new mission, undertaken with some of his father's old crew, follows the plants to their root and discover an undiscovered land, with odd creatures.
 So, there are some positives to it. The vocal performances are good. The visuals are, to a point good. The creatures I found to be a bit bland, but there is an explanation within the story as to why they look the way they do. There are a few funny moments along the way. The environmental aspect of the story is worthy and some of that came as a pleasant surprise.
 But it has to be said that the rest of the plot is pretty underwhelming. It's a pedestrian adventure once we're underground and, though there are a couple of surprises that you will certainly see coming, there's not really an action scene to really get the heart racing.
 I've had a patchy time with Disney's own animated releases over the past few years, with ""Encanto"" being much better than ""Raya and the Last Dragon"" and with ""Strange World"" closer to the latter than the former. I'm more forgiving of this than I might be, as we watched it on Disney Plus and my son enjoyed it, than I would be had I been to the cinema."
STRANGE WORLD,"It's not truly bad, but it's not good either. It has a lot of great and interesting ideas that just sort of flounder around looking for something to do. Characters are not well fleshed out. Everything felt sort of pointless. It has few laughs and no tears. Lots of things happen and quickly resolve without consequence. The overall outcome for the characters would have been similar even if they'd stayed home. It's pretty, but all the characters are bulbous and squishy with no expression. In short, it's nothing special--just a bland, inoffensive trip into a glowing place.
 Ethan is especially annoying. Frequently putting himself and others in danger; he remains oblivious and immune to the consequences of his actions, and is ultimately rewarded for being a reckless teenager. He doesn't have any ambition, skills, or direction. Stuff just kind of happens to him. Is he the main character? It was hard to tell.
 I think this one can safely be skipped. You won't be missing much."
STRANGE WORLD,I didn't hate it
STRANGE WORLD,"Disappointment This movie is a the epitome of cliche . We felt the same when we left the theater as we entered it. We came with our children full of hope for a nice family film, however, about halfway in, we just wanted it to end. The movie didn't make us laugh or make us cry, it didn't move us at all. We felt like empty plastic throughout the film. As much as we wanted to feel something, the movie went nowhere. It was formulaic and predictable. The characters are shallow and unrelatable. The animation is nice as well as the action, but it was lacking a story line . If we could ask for a refund, unfortunately, we would. Definitely not recommended."
STRANGE WORLD,"Why was this made? It's been a few days since I took the kids to see this, and I can barely remember anything about the movie. The visuals were pretty good, and there were some unique visual design elements throughout, but the design of the main characters was lacking compared to minor side characters, and the pink-pudding texture grew stale quickly.
 The plot was non-existent. Is it a family reunion story? A redemption story? A save the world story? A coming of age story? The characters' motivations change from moment moment and scene to scene - whatever is convenient for the writers in the moment.
 The big twist was apparent from a mile away, and lacked internal consistency.
 This movie didn't do anything new, just a new jumble of old ideas. At least the popcorn was tasty."
STRANGE WORLD,"Great adventure Strange World's humour takes a little while to find it's footing and once it does it becomes a great adventure full of heart, wonder and emotion whilst actually delivering meaningful representation that feels like a major first for a studio that has been frustratingly scared of commitment in that department.
 Jake Gyllenhaal gives a great lead performance and is a natural at voice acting and his believable father son dynamic with a superb Jaboukie Young-White makes for a strong emotional core. Dennis Quaid is also memorable and is one of the funniest characters.
 Don Hall's and Qui Nguyen's direction is excellent with a super vibrant animation style that strikes a really strong balance between photo real and more fantastical designs. The music by Henry Jackman is really good, delivering the necessary sense of awe and wonder."
STRANGE WORLD,Charming Adventure Flick Not Worth the Backlash
STRANGE WORLD,"World of disappointment Strange World is rather a big disappointment from Walt Disney, than being a Sci-fi element filled adventure movie. The only thing that was laudable in the movie was the CGI and the special effects used.
 The director Don Hall and his co-director and screenwriter Qui Nguyen (who last year collaborated on an another Disney picture, ""Raya and the Last Dragon"") seem to have put all of their effort into gaudy backgrounds, wacky gadgets and strange ancillary monsters instead of into dramatic urgency or conflict. The film's stumbling unoriginality, cliched characters and intended jokes that land like flops leads to a boring viewing experience, even though the plot and animation were good enough.
 My Rating : 4.5/10."
STRANGE WORLD,The animation is terrific; the plot is not
STRANGE WORLD,"Nothing wrong with this movie. This movie is good and I'm kind of wondering why everyone is complaining. It's for kids and I really see nothing wrong with it to deserve such low ratings. The story is about living harmoniously with nature and to follow one's own path in life, all wrapped up in an adventure story on a crazy lovecraftian landscape. It was cool enough to me. Don't listen to these reviews, let your kid watch the movie, the ask if they hated it. As an adult, it passed the time better than most Disney cartoons. When I was young I hated the little mermaid, Snow White, beauty and the beast, and most other Disney cartoons( alladin was good though). If strange world came out when I was young I would of thought it was great."
STRANGE WORLD,"A rather uninteresting world There were no surprises at all in this ecological metaphor for fossil fuel use. In. Fact another reviewer had this as a B movie. I would not have even given it that. A one dimensional country which relies on a finite resource. A one dimensional plot involving a lost explorer and the family whole seek him. Amazingly human miming and behaving denizens of a lost world. Terrible dialogue.
 Overall, this supposedly family adventure never gained momentum from the get go. There were no real sense of perils, despite there being plenty opportunities. Solutions to problems just fell out of the sky. I am surprised this scored as high as it did."
STRANGE WORLD,"I don't get the hate Stunning visuals, well-realized sci-fi setting, hilarious one-liners, and filled with shocking twists! What's not to love?
 Maybe I just set my expectations too low, but this film really subverted my predictions in the best ways possible. Though characters are quite generic and we've seen the typical ""I don't want to become my father"" done plenty of times before, the family dynamic felt genuine. The film shows how men strive to live up to their father's expectations. All three main characters represent different generations, and their arcs lead to a predictable outcome, but insightful nonetheless.
 The useless side characters provide nothing except for exposition, and their attempts at comic relief fall painfully flat. I found the comedy was well-timed and it didn't clash with the occasionally serious tone, but it's truly hilarious when the main trio are part of the joke. It takes itself seriously at the right moments to execute heartfelt scenes and deliver not-so-subtle climate change commentary. If there's one thing I would've loved more of is world-building; though the fictional world is well thought out with infrastructure and an economy influenced by the scifi setting, it could've been explored more if the runtime were a bit longer before going into the strange world.
 7.5/10."
STRANGE WORLD,"Nothing Strange Here, just bad First the good points, I gave it a one star in that animation was okay. Now the minus 9 points. The plot was boring and dull. The action scenes were wimpy. Most of the characters are unlikeable - which if they were supposed to be bad guys/vilans would of been great. I couldn't relate to any the characters and had no one to root for. The script was disjointed as to where is this going and who cares. I thought it was my perception but I spoke to several other friends and two noted they got 20 minutes into it and turned it off. I'd like to know what Disney was thinking when they first green lighted this project. Nothing strange here folks, it's a big disappointment all around."
STRANGE WORLD,"A good movie without being perfect. ""Strange World"" is an animated film whose script focuses on following your own path and finding yourself, as well as telling a story that aims to leave us a message about the importance of taking care of our body and our planet. The animation is excellent and obviously influenced by the adventure world of Verne and even a bit of Lovecraft, achieving great settings. Sometimes the movie feels different due to the lack of a villain played by any character, but it manages to come out on top without being perfect. The film will annoy closed-minded conservatives but that doesn't matter. An interesting production that achieves its mission of entertaining and leaving a good message."
STRANGE WORLD,Eh
STRANGE WORLD,"Look beyond the cloud of stereotypes, things are not what they seem: give this movie a chance (1st two paragraphs are not spoilers)"
STRANGE WORLD,"A rousing and colorful adventure story with a strong visual identity even if it has some rougher edges that could've been refined Set in the land of Avalonia which is surrounded by several impenetrable mountains, Jaeger Clade (Dennis Quaid) is a legendary adventurer whose adventures are known throughout the land. However Jaeger's son Searcher (Jake Gyllenhaal) despite having accompanied his father on his adventures since birth doesn't share Jaeger's love of adventure and is more interested in plant care and farming. Following a rift between the two where Jaeger ventured out to search beyond the mountains and was never seen again, Searcher discovered a plant based energy source called Pando which has lead Avalonia into an era of unprecedented technological marvels that have revolutionized life in Avalonia. Searcher now lives as a Pando farmer with his wife Meridian (Gabrielle Union) and son Ethan (Jaboukie Young-White) who secretly wants to be an explorer but hasn't yet told Searcher. When president of Avalonia, Callisto Mal (Lucy Liu), visits the Clade farm to inform them that Pando has been stricken with some sort of blight and is projected to be gone soon, she organizes an expedition into a recently uncovered subterranean entrance that has appeared and enlists Searcher to help on the expedition as he discovered Pando. Once on the expedition along with Meridian and Ethan who become entangled, the group meets up with the presumed dead Jaeger and the group try to uncover what is killing the Pando.
 Strange World is the latest Disney Animation film coming to us from director Don Hall of Big Hero 6, Raya and the Last Dragon, and Moana and written by Qui Nguyen who previously wrote Raya. The film was inspired by the likes of pulp adventure stories from the likes of King Kong and Doc Savage to other more classic adventure tales like those of Jules Verne or Edgar Rice Burroughs. The movie is certainly an impressive visual marvel and has a strong sense of adventure, but much like Raya and the Last Dragon while there's a strong framework at play there's a bunch of little elements that pile up and keep me from liking it more than I do.
 Unsurprisingly for a Don Hall directed animated film, Strange World is rich in colorful visuals and designs with the land of Avalonia a very impressive world with lots of fun details that play well to the likes of people who love the style of things like 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea or Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow with that pulp adventure/retro future vibe that I'm admittedly a sucker for. Once we begin our adventure into the subterranean world beneath Avalonia there's a strong sense of discovery with a strong desire to understand what this world is and how it works and the movie does what a good adventure story should do and makes you want to know more about this world and dive further into it.
 Where the movie has issues for me is in the clunky writing in the first act of the film particularly with Gyllenhaal's performance as Searcher which feels like it was directed to play very broadly and I think the script makes Searcher maybe a tad too unaware and accident prone with some scenes that seem more suited to a modern day sitcom than what's supposed to be a timeless adventure story (we definitely get a few ""ramble"" jokes here and there in the beginning). Once the film moves into the adventure section past the slightly clunky expository first act the movie does get a better sense of what it wants to be and we get some good moments with Dennis Quaid's Jaeger Claude whose sort of an over the top homage to Doc Savage type pulp heroes who literally laugh at danger. Jaboukie Young White's Ethan makes for a sympathetic lead as Ethan and is certainly better than the last LGBTQ character Disney placed in an adventure story as unlike Jack Whitehall's character from Jungle Cruise Ethan at least contributes to the plot and isn't a cartoonishly useless coward. Much like Searcher he is prone to accidents and mistakes but at least he has the buffer of being a teenager so it's less grating than when Searcher indulges in similar antics. As with other such animated Disney properties they also overindulge on the ""cute sidekicks"" with one creature called Splat reasonably entertaining, but the Clade's three legged dog Legend is undeniably in the same space as creatures such as Heihei the Chicken from Moana and makes you ask (why is he even here?).
 Strange World is a good movie that could've been a great one with a bit more c=polish on the script and characters. In terms of comparable animated sci-fi films I wasn't as engrossed with it as Treasure Planet, but I'd place it more or less alongside something like Titan A. E. in terms of entertainment value."
STRANGE WORLD,"Dull Focused more on being inclusive than writing a decent storyline. Felt like a bootleg copy of a kids version of Avatar. The parents we went with fell asleep at one point and I found my popcorn to be more entertaining than the awkward dialogue they had throughout the whole movie.
 The characters were flat. Some of the side characters were more entertaining, and that's not saying much. Even cool looking Splat thing they found should have been called Flop.
 For a kids movie I can't even remember any of the jokes or anything that made my kids laugh.
 They like some of the action... So there's that for the 1 star."
STRANGE WORLD,"Visually beautiful movie about family expectations This one really felt like a Pixar film more than a typical Disney movie. Disney continued the trend of no villian. Instead the movie dealt with family conflict similar to Encanto. Instead of granddaughter who had issues with a grandmother, this film dealt with problems among three generations of fathers and sons.
 Most of the movie takes place in a beautiful unexplored place near the community of Avalonia. Avalonia is a land surrounded by impassable mountains. No one knows what is on the other side. Our explorers leave on a quest to discover why an important crop is failing. In the process, they not only discover a new land, but also discover more about themselves.
 The scenery is gorgeous. The new place looks like cross between an underwater ocean and regular land. Starfish-looking creatures swing through the trees. A pod of skate-type creatures swim through the air. It reminded me of an ocean enough that I felt myself relax the same way I do when I look at a real ocean. Ahhhhhh
 Some people may not enjoy the movie as there is no princess, no singing, and no big baddie to defeat. I enjoyed the movie.
 Since I now know what the new land is, I'll see if I can spot the clues the next time I watch it. I did spot one clue, but brushed it off as the animators attempts to make the landscape look alien.
 I do recommend this film."
HALLOWEEN ENDS,"Should be called ""Corey's Halloween"""
HALLOWEEN ENDS,"Cheap and random ""conclusion"" to the franchise"
HALLOWEEN ENDS,"It should have ended with 2018... Yeah this movie proves why this should NEVER have been a trilogy in the first place... Kills was a letdown and this was the final nail in the coffin!
 This movie introduces an entirely new storyline and character, which is not the way you close off a trilogy! The concept around this is interesting enough, but as a conclusion to a long running franchise, it could not have been more bafflingly misplaced!
 Micheal Myers is reduced to a cameo and the final confrontation comes out of nowhere, with NO build up or satisfaction! The confrontation in 2018 was better than this! It is clear that there were not material enough for a trilogy so why? Oh Yeah.... money."
HALLOWEEN ENDS,"Halloween ends, in the toilet..."
HALLOWEEN ENDS,I think I threw up in my mouth a little bit.
HALLOWEEN ENDS,"Why Would They Do This Halloween Ends is a total shambles. An absolute joke of a movie. I thought Halloween Kills was bad...this makes Kills look like a masterpiece.
 The name Corey Cunningham will forever be a black mark on the Halloween series. Like seriously, why would they do this? This is up there with ""do your thing cuz"" from the Texas Chainsaw 3D.
 The Allyson character is such a non character that it never makes sense why she even would go near Corey in the first place. She is basically just whatever the script calls for at any particular moment.
 Jamie Lee is given little to do as in the previous film, she is pretty much a non-entity for the majority of the movie despite being the face of the franchise.
 The other face of the franchise, Michael, is done such a disservice it's hard to even call this a Halloween movie. It's mad to think Malek Akkad let them run with this kind of story with so little Michael.
 Is Halloween Ends the worst movie ever made? Perhaps not. Is Halloween Ends the worst Halloween movie they could possibly have made? Definitely."
HALLOWEEN ENDS,"Actually worse than Halloween Kills Didn't think it was possible but Halloween Ends was actually a million times worse than Halloween Kills. Yikes. This one was just plain out DUMB. It was pointless and a waste of time and money. Bad acting, pointless weird love story during most of it. Michael only made a couple cameos and we didn't see him for at least 45 minutes. The main male character was just weird. Most important of all, for a Halloween movie, this one absolutely lacked the Halloween ""feel"" of the other franchises. No trick or treat or scary halloween vibes here. I feel so bad for JLC for getting wrapped up in this garbage. Despite the bad reviews, I still watched it just for nostalgia's sake and to be my own judge of the film but they are all absolutely correct in saying this was the worst Halloween movie ever made. The ending was just as bad as the middle and the beginning. The writers and directors, even the casting directors should all retire."
HALLOWEEN ENDS,"Very dissapointing First, this trylogy should have been only one movie with a better conclusion. The third movie is even worse than the second. And the second was weak.
 Second, I don't understand how you can do a great Halloween (2018) comeback, but then two of the worst Hallowen movies from all time.
 Last, Halloween Ends (2022) is poor as a movie. Sometimes embarrassing. The script is bad, pretty bad. Acting is horrendous, soap opera level. And the conclusion is a joke. A bad one.
 To add, Michael deserved better than this. Hopefully in the future someone can fix it, and give it the conclusion that deserves as an horror icon."
HALLOWEEN ENDS,"Arguably the Worst of the Halloween Franchise Just streamed this on Peacock. There's areaon they decided to stick this on a streaming service and in the theatres simultaneously. It's a bomb and they can blame the low box office on also streaming at the same time.
 It's a mess of a movie and little of it makes sense.
 I'm not going to write any spoliers but just let me say while the acting is OK and the directon is OK the story is completely idiotic.
 The ending is not just confusing, it makes no sense.
 Does Curtis need the money? Maybe she's giving her fee to charity. She had to know this is the worst of ALL Halloween movies going back to the 70's.
 AND it's 2 hours long. You'll be dozing off.
 And BTW, I'd bet my dwindling fortune, that there will be another Halloween movie next year."
HALLOWEEN ENDS,"Oh Hi Mark Halloween Ends is a deep film.
 It really makes you question which choices in your life led you to this moment. Just think about this. You're watching the thirteenth installment of a simple and good film made 44 years ago. Michael Myers has become a blood-transmitted disease, and Halloween is now a self-meta pseudophilosophical parody nightmare.
 The time-space continuum was broken, and Haddonfield now exists in two temporal realities simultaneously - 1978 and 2019. People act like videogame NPCs, you press the interaction key, and they speak in random text lines or do random things.
 There are many scenes in this film, none of which are connected in any way but are very diverse in nature. There was some good gore, and funny parody sketches with actors almost laughing on set.
 The film almost drove me into an epileptic seizure 30 minutes in, but then Shaft showed up, and things got really cool.
 In all seriousness, it seems to me that the script was assembled from scraps of something else, most likely a gritty thriller set in the '70s setting. They took some scene ideas and just slapped them over the tired Halloween routine.
 There is one more possibility, though. They probably wanted to pull off a Matrix sequel, making it bad and saying it was made that way deliberately. But this only works once, and they already did it with The Matrix Resurrections. So, intentionally making it trash doesn't justify anything.
 Overall rating - garbage fire/10. Looking forward to more sequels."
HALLOWEEN ENDS,"When does the real finale come out? I don't know what this movie was but I am still waiting on the real final movie in the trilogy to be released. This was just a bad joke right? I kept watching hoping that it would get better and it just didn't I had heard the final act was good and I was lied to. Then I am not sure what message they were trying to send with their wacky symbolism they do but it went over my head. When it was over me and the girlfriend just felt crushed that it was such a bad movie. 2018 was great and kills was ok but this makes me angry and sad at how disappointing it was.
 This wasn't a Halloween movie. It takes place on halloween and Michael and Laurie cameo in it but that's it. Every time I look at the rating I am giving it I lower the score because I feel I am being too generous."
HALLOWEEN ENDS,"No, Just...omg, No,No and No. I'm not sure who thought this script was a good idea because it's not. If there is a film in film school called ""How to ruin a franchise"" this would be it. As a lifelong die hard Halloween fan I have a love for the good ones and the bad but this along with Halloween Kills is just a no. So much potential was wasted and im not even going to mention the plot or any details. Halloween Ends is an insult to the characters, the ideas and the franchise. It borders offensive. While Halloween Kills has redeeming values Ends just screws it all to high heaven. The final insult is that Michael Myers has been reduced to a couple cameos in his own film. Watch it on a streaming service or somewhere else for free and give it a try just for nostalgias sake but you have been warned. I gave it a 5 because the Halloween franchise has a soft spot with me and I can't bear to give it a lower score."
HALLOWEEN ENDS,"The weakest Halloween - romantic drama, rather than a slasher This is an affront to both fans of the series as well the casual viewing audience. It is a romantic drama for most of the first 75 minutes and doesn't even remotely approach Michael Myers and Laurie Strode and their supposedly final show down.
 The first hour has the most preposterous love story that you can come up with. I can't believe that it took four persons to write this tripe. This is punctuated by Jamie Lee Curtis's predisposition to spout supposedly deep, imbued with psychological meaning cliches.
 It doesn't improve at all and closes down with a whimper. It brought to me memories of Halloween 3, which released around 3.5 decades ago and to me was the worst entry in the entire series.
 David Gordon Green had reinvigorated a long dead series with the classic Halloween (2018). He has ensured that the rekindled interest of the audience gets buried after suffering through this."
HALLOWEEN ENDS,"""Ends"" has murdered Michael Myers, with poor writing and disrespect for his franchise"
HALLOWEEN ENDS,"Did I watch the wrong movie? Another failed sequel of a classic horror flick. There was no Micheal Myers anywhere for most of the movie! That shouldn't be the final movie of a legendary horror movie character. We focused way too much on side characters, wasting so much time of the movie and taking away screen time from Michael for no reason. Laurie was once again the best in the movie. The actress played her role really well and I enjoyed seeing her probably for the last time. Her granddaughter as a character was annoying, like those straight to VHS Disney movies where the kid wod turn against their parents for stupid reasons, that was her in the entire movie... It was disappointing but I'm glad I watched it because it ends a huge franchise I've been watching since middle school. It was a pop corn movie and nothing more, but still an okay pop corn movie."
HALLOWEEN ENDS,"Beyond a let down is an understatement. I won't say anything that happens in the movie, I'll just complain and start with-If you absolutely have to see this movie watch it on a streaming service. But it's not even worth that. A 20 minute short film of just the ending would have been the only way this movie would have been good.. Absolutely NO WAY they didn't screw this up on purpose. A 4 year old with no concept of the series and possibly not even potty trained could have made a better film. Why they would end it with this? Honestly an insult to fans, past writers and everyone and thing involved. I think it's time the series ends. Will always love the original. Heck, I loved 2018. How they started it back up with 2018 and ended it with horrible slap in the face is astonishing.."
HALLOWEEN ENDS,What happened?
HALLOWEEN ENDS,"How do you go from 2018 to this??? I am not going to tear this down like some others have because it truth the movie is neither a 1 or a 2, nor is it a 10 or a 9, a 5 is exactly where this film should land.
 What started off with a great pick-up with Halloween 2018, slowly began to derail when it moved onto Kills, and here I thought we would have something to at least restore some of the awesomeness of 2018, and wash some of the stink of kills, but NOPE... we get a real mess of a story that some how steals the voodoo powers of Charles Lee Ray (CHucky) and spins him into the Halloween Universe... it is a tragedy.
 I mean come on, this is the best they had to offer to us? It is not as bad as some have made it out to be, definitely not as bad as the Rob Zombie entries, but this definitely is a TEXTBOOK way to NOT end a trilogy of films.
 I don't want to get into spoilers but if you read this before watching, go in with LOW expectations and you might come out not feelin as ripped off."
HALLOWEEN ENDS,"I have no words for this massive train wreck of a film This will be a short review as I genuinely don't want to give this film any more time than I already have.
 Writing is terrible, cringe worthy, and forgettable. The dialogue just had me saying ""shoot yourself"" and ""people don't talk like this"" multiple times. I suppose the nicest thing I can say for this film is that it looked good and the kills were bloody and messy, also a certain subplot I liked but I'll get to that later. The kills though they were also downright hilarious.
 Which will lead me to say this film only escapes being a 1 because of how much I was laughing. It was like a train wreck that I couldn't stop watching.
 Now for the subplot which I will not spoil, I will say that at first it had me rolling my eyes but as the film progressed it was getting more outlandish and because of that I came around to this plot line and just wanted them to go all the way with it. If they have I would've just been dying in my theater seat.
 Anyway this is exactly how I anticipated Halloween Ends to be especially after Kills, the only relief I have is that it's finally over. At least until the inevitable Halloween reboot/remake.
 IMDb: 2/10 Letterboxd: 2/5
 Watched in Theaters."
HALLOWEEN ENDS,"Misleading trailers allowed a HORRIBLE ""Halloween""movie to make millions! Blumhouse knew they had a very bad movie on their hands, so they purposely left the real Corey Cunningham character arc out of the trailers. Let's not forget that the trailers for the last two movies were very bad for revealing WAY too much! Not the case here. They knew this movie would have been a box office bomb if fans had the slighest hint of how the CC character would actually play out. We the fans were duped into thinking we were going to see a great final installment of a trilogy, when it was anything but.
 Despite the awful and laughable 'amateur hour' script, the movie was still boring. And worst of all, on top of everything else, there was not one single scary scene. MM was a feeble and weak after thought in his own movie. So are we supposed to be scared of Corey Cunningham in a childs plastic scarecrow mask?! Seriously?!?!
 Shame on everyone that was apart of this! The movie was an absolute DISGRACE!!!"
HALLOWEEN ENDS,"Writers have amnesia and forgot what they last 2 movies were about... People loathed Rob Zombie's Halloween for spending an hour showing you his childhood.
 Then Halloween Ends said ""hold my beer...""
 This new trilogy literally took the story of one movie and stretched it out into three. This is how you end up with pointless drama and random new characters.
 The people behind these should be ashamed of themselves. They were not made by true Halloween fans and were not made for true Halloween fans.
 These filmmakers had far too much freedom with a franchise with a rich history...and it shows.
 What a sad way to see an empty, lifeless and meaningless end to such a character.
 I can't even begin to convey how insanely inept it is to see the ""emotional"" climax with booming John Carpenter music and its the first glimpse of an actual Halloween movie but there's only 3 minutes of movie left.
 They forgot to build up to the climax...the climax they wanted to move you with yet not guide you to.
 Stupid stupid stupid writing and directing.
 The dialogue was cringy and nothing that any self-respecting humans would ever say out loud. There are moments when we should just be shown emphasis on something when imstead we get spoon-fed awful words to make certain our dumb brains know what's going on. The characters go against their nature just to make the story move, the story that seems to have been written the day before shooting. And they forgot that the last movie of a trilogy should sum up the characters from the previous installments and not resemble the first movie of a new trilogy.
 OH, and they forgot this movie is about Michael Myers too. I know, I know. Easy mistake right...
 My god, the fact that these exist just crushes my heart and any remaining faith in Hollywood as competent storytellers.
 I just can't."
HALLOWEEN ENDS,Halloween Resurrection is no longer last place...
HALLOWEEN ENDS,"A mess of a film that repeats the same things Halloween Ends, the so call ""last"" Halloween movie. Don't buy it one bit, because I am sure Hollywood already has plans to ""reboot"" the series in a few years, doing the same old ""we are going to ignore all the sequels and only take the first one"" plot again. They did that with Halloween H20, and then they did it again in 2018.
 This is just the same old thing over and over again guys, there is no difference. The worst thing is that this movie is 100% false advertising. It is two different things, it is a weird teenage dating movie, then becomes a slasher towards the tale end. Don't believe the advertising, Michael Myers is barely in this thing.
 The Halloween series is like the Nightmare on Elm Street series, the first one is a masterpiece, then everything else is just silly, unnecessary, and lame (Halloween 3 was all right though).
 If you must watch this, watch it for free using a friends account or whatever. Jamie Lee Curtis is great as always, but they just make her do the same thing and the same old ""I'm a tough S. O. B. And I ain't scared of Michael Myers"" attitude that she has had since the 2018 movie. Her tough woman talk is just kinda old at this point, we get it she has become ""Sarah Connor"" from ""Terminator 2.""
 The 2018 movie was a good return, but to be 1000% honest, Halloween Kills and Halloween Ends are just straight up cash grabs. They only spent 20 million on this, knowing they can ""trick"" fans into watching another one by putting the word ""Ends"" on it.
 We all know it ain't ending anytime $oon.
 1/10."
HALLOWEEN ENDS,"Beyond disappointed I liked Halloween 2018, didn't love it but thought it was a serviceable effort. Halloween Kills was cheesy in some ways (evil dies tonight was so cringey) but the atmosphere was spooky and the kills were vicious and gore filled enough to keep my interest. Halloween Ends is so boring and absurdly convoluted I was a bit shocked. Just a dumb, boring and frankly not scary whatsoever. Whoever wrote this should not be paid. The plot was so stupid and the character motivation was absurd. Not what I expected at all after watching the first two. They totally dropped the ball on the finale. I couldn't be more disappointed and will never rewatch or purchase this movie. Terrible. Awful. Would never recommend."
HALLOWEEN ENDS,"Shalloween Descends... It's fair to say that all good things must come to an end, they come to a point where there's just no more dividend, there's nothing to commend, or even to distend, there's no point in extruding something you just cannot defend, that is unless there's money to be made from an extend, even though the franchise has a hideous downward trend, has gone round and round the bend, become a toxic and quite odorous elongated blend, takes you to a place you just can't comprehend, with almost zero reasons to promote and/or to recommend, leaving one, and only one conclusion that the you need to apprehend, it's as useless as pulled pumpkin pulp and needs to be condemned."
WHITE NOISE,"ignore the white noise I don't know how to describe this film, but it almost feels like watching 3 different films. It started like a parody of dead poet society, then follows up by a parody of war of the world, then a parody of unfaithful. And it seems like there's no correlation between these sequences.
 Yes, i'm aware White Noise is a satire of a supposedly average american family dealing with mundane troubles of death, live, love blah blah blah. Yes, i know it's based on a novel. No, i haven't read the novel. But seeing this film as is, and for whatever this film trying to be, i don't find it entertaining. Most of the humorous aspects are cringe.
 4/10.
 It's a 'surrealism film' , but not really."
WHITE NOISE,"When the methamphetamines kick in and you start to write a screenplay. White noise definition: A constant background noise, especially one that drowns out other sounds. White noise helps get a better quality night's sleep by masking environmental or outside noises that are causing disturbed sleep, thus falling asleep much faster and effortlessly. Exactly.
 The only difference from the definition and this film's title, is that white noise is constant and soothing, while this boring nonsense excuse of a film was all over the place and annoying. The constant incoherent blabbering and irrelevant convoluted sub-plots became a cringe-fest quickly. The entire runtime was utterly disjointed and exhaustingly unbalanced. Almost every scene had no reason to be included with any other scene. It's a bunch of failed older screenplays shredded then randomly taped together. Even the embarrassingly abundant cheap product placement wont pay the bills for this flop. This has to be the biggest waste of film production I've seen in a long time. Even the talented cast were to be laughed at, not laughed with, which is about the only comedy in this film. All the critics who praised this nonsense clearly inhaled the fumes. So don't waste your time with this even if you're curious, it's 136 minutes of your life you will never get back. This nonsense should be studied in film schools on what not to do. It's a very generous 2/10, only for the decent score and pity for the cast that have to have their names attached to this."
WHITE NOISE,"An interesting failure, but a failure nonetheless White Noise is, undoubtedly, the strangest movie Netflix has released this year, which is saying a lot given the competition. The plot is all over the place, the dialogue very stylized, and the overall atmosphere is engaging but off-putting. It's the type of movie that is sure to cause a lot of division in audiences.
 At its core, White Noise is about a college professor named Jack and his middle class family dealing with their fear of death, but what actually happens is quite complicated. So complicated, in fact, that it feels like three separate movies smashed together. To be fair, the novel is just as ungainly and incoherent, but at least you had the sense that you were the one with the problem. There was a mystique to DeLillo's writing that made it seem like there was a lot going on thematically with the strange choices. But in the movie? It just seems like bad, pretentious writing. I'm not even sure if Baumbach knew what DeLillo's aim was, or if he just guessed.
 One symptom of this is that the unnatural dialogue stick out like a sore thumb: in a scene where Jack's wife, Babette, says how open she is with communicating her feelings, Driver says ""That is the point of Babette."" In another moment, Jack is shopping with his coworker when said coworker suddenly says that Jack's wife's ""hair looks important."" What is the point of lines like this? Because all it accomplishes is taking you out of the moment and reminding you that you're watching a movie with a script. Not to mention the multiple long, unintelligible ""philosophical"" monologues that occasionally pop up. Is it an intentional commentary on the hollowness of academia? If so, then why are they presented so uncritically and played dead straight? It's just another disjointed element of the movie that seems unfinished.
 But even if the script fails them, the cast and tech crew don't give up on trying. Driver and Gerwig give very different performances, the former acting almost like an intentional caricature of a sitcom dad, and the latter trying to be serious the whole time. And yet it's one of the few disparate combinations in the film that actually pays off: their acting is convincing as a real couple. Gerwig, in particular, brings emotion to scenes that were completely absent of it on the page. The production design and score are also on point, creating a distinct and interesting atmosphere that also furthers the film's supposed social commentary. But none of this is quite enough to save White Noise from itself and its shortcomings.
 The best part of the film is far and away the end credits. I'm not saying that as some sort of flippant joke about the movie's quality, it's a genuinely incredible sequence. Somehow it captures the exact type of weirdness and existentialism and fun that's absent from the rest of the movie. It's so good that, in all honesty, you could probably skip the rest of the movie for it. White Noise is consistently watchable and unique, unlike anything else you'll see this year. But it's aimless, confused, and ultimately baffling to make any significant impact.
 Final Score: 62/100."
WHITE NOISE,"For a limited audience Most of the reviews that I have read thus far were negative, or a bit overly kind. The low rating is likely due to people going out for a light story, expecting to see a disaster action flick or end of the world comedy. This is essentially a reflection on mans fear of his own mortality, or perhaps more specifically on a certain subcultures fixation on their own impending end. If you take the movie as a series of reflections on that idea, and most of the characters as representations of certain personality types, perspectives and ideologies, then it all makes a lot of sense. And, it is pretty damn (darkly) funny as well. Enjoy."
WHITE NOISE,"The parts don't cohere into a whole that works It's funny when you encounter a film with so many likeable elements that simply never cohere into something that works. This film reminded me of ""I Heart Huckabees"" in that sense ... I enjoyed all the parts considered in isolation, but the film itself is decidedly less than the sum of it's parts.
 The film is divided into three acts. We're introduced to star professor of Hitler Studies Adam Driver and his wife Greta Gerwig and their children (almost all from different spouses) in the first act, which gestures at parodying academia without really landing much.
 In the middle act, a train crash causes the Airborne Toxic Event ... a cloud of poisonous chemicals that descends on town and causes the family to evacuate. This is the most successful part of the film, impressively staging the event like a darkly comedic disaster film.
 The final act is ... a lot less clear and probably best not spoiled. It deals with our need to distract ourselves from the terrors of life with medicine and consumerism. It descends into talky meandering and is really only saved by a magnificent musical number over the end credits.
 There's really a lot to like. I found it to be intermittently quite funny. The performances are great, especially Don Cheadle as a fellow professor trying to establish a specialization in Elvis Studies. It's a hugely ambitious film with a unique visual style. I only wish I could say I actually liked it."
WHITE NOISE,"Really? Started watching and the characters just spoke constantly over each other, no need or desire to think about what they were saying, no clue what they were actually saying, no time to process what they were saying. So I put the subtitles on, that might help I thought, nope, still couldn't keep up, the type of conversation I would find inanely dull in real life and would walk away from. Then after 30 minutes of watching I asked my husband if he had any idea what this film was about, nope he replied. Can we be bothered when we just want to be entertained? Nope. Communication is important in a film, this film finds communication a difficult task. Obviously we turned it off, why waste our time. People state on here that it's thought provoking, well I disagree and think real life is far more thought provoking and entertaining than a family that cannot communicate clearly."
WHITE NOISE,Garbage masquerading as thought-provoking
WHITE NOISE,"All Over The Place For the first hour of White Noise, I found myself very entertained. But for the second half I found myself incredibly bored. They felt like two separate films. If the first half had just been the whole film. I probably would have have given this film an 8. Or possibly a 9. It goes from being an apocalyptic family satire, to a revenge tale. I believe Noah Baumbach didn't even know what exactly he was going for. White Noise was average. The two aspects holding me back from giving it a 4 are again the first half and another stellar performance from Adam Driver. Nowhere near as good as Marriage Story. Then again they are very different films."
WHITE NOISE,Says it was a comedy. It wasn't funny.
WHITE NOISE,"DeLillo's novel hits the big screen Greetings again from the darkness. Writer-director Noah Baumbach's latest film is one of those that causes us to feel a bit guilty at not finding it as important or noble as it finds itself. That's not meant to be as critical as it sounds. Afterall, Baumbach is the one who has managed to bring the ""unfilmable"" ... Don DeLillo's 1985 novel (National Book Award for fiction) ... to the big screen. Baumbach's last film was MARRIAGE STORY (2019), a masterpiece on relationships, and while this current film is a more ambitious undertaking, it likely will prove less accessible to many viewers.
 Adam Driver stars as Jack Gladney, a professor at a (fictitious) midwestern college, who has reached celebrity status through his Hitler studies curriculum - although he remains uneasy at his own inability to speak German. Jack's own home life teeters on bedlam most every day. He and his wife Babbette (Greta Gerwig, director Baumbach's real life spouse) are both on their fourth marriage, and their blended family of kids results in tension and more overlapping dialogue than one would find in a filled sports arena. Babbette is showing signs of early onset dementia, and is regularly and secretly taking a drug called Dylar. Of course, it's the 1980's and Google hasn't been born, so Jack and Babbette's daughter Denise (Raffey Cassidy) find themselves scouring books and asking doctors about the mysterious drug.
 There are some amazing lines (most taken straight from DeLillo's novel) throughout the film, and Act 1 features a stunning rap-battle type lecture with Jack and his colleague Murray Suskind (Don Cheadle) taking on Elvis versus Hitler and their relationships with their respective mothers. It's filmed like a boxing match and most of the students seem oblivious to this treat. Act 2 is labeled ""The Airborne Toxic Event"" and it's a fiery tanker car (filled with toxic waste) explosion that marks the transition. A mass evacuation takes the family to Camp Daffodil for 9 days, and Jack's limited exposure to the toxic air places him in peril and leads to Act 3 where the fear of death merges with the discovery of Babbette's Dylar source. The question then becomes, will Jack first die or commit murder ... because, as we are told, men are killers.
 Jack's son is aptly named Heinrich and is played by Sam Nivola (the son of Alessandro Nivola and Emily Mortimer). Baumbach is an intellect obsessed with neurotic intellectual characters, and he thrives at blurring the line between satire and societal commentary ... which is obviously why he was drawn to DeLillo's novel. The film is often chaotic, and is an odd blend of science fiction teasing the end of our world, the price of consumerism, and existential contemplation reflecting our fear of death. Especially effective are the Production Design of Jess Gonchor and the work of composer Danny Elfman. Perhaps there could be no better ending than the dance number in the vitally important local grocery store that continues through the closing credits. The film is funny, frightening, and a bit of a downer that offers more questions than answers - an adaptation that serves the novel.
 Opening in theaters on December 2, 2022."
WHITE NOISE,"God, this must be THE worst Noah Baumbach movie so far... God, this must be THE worst Noah Baumbach movie so far... From the AWFUL opening where they ping pong dialogue between each family member like a carefully constructed sitcom. NO ONE, and I mean, NO ONE speaks like that. It was so painful to watch and I was ready to turn it off right there and then. Just terrible writing. I didn't believe a word of what was said.
 It is a big Hollywood mistake to make sure not to have actors walk on the other actors lines, but because of it, the dialogue feels wooden, rehearsed and unnatural.
 The movie was all over the place and din't know what it wanted to be. Not every book needs to be made into a film.
 I like Noah's other films. Even though he tries to be early Woody Allen, his films has always had a certain quality of realism that I enjoyed. He needs to stick to his own writing which has worked for him.
 It was almost like Wes Anderson directed this, overly staged and weird.
 What it showed is that mediocre people can teach unsophisticated vulnerable teenagers and indoctrinate them with such ease.
 What's really sad is the amount of money they spent on this atrocity.
 SKIP IT, go watch his earlier films."
WHITE NOISE,"Tune it out The filmmakers aimed to make something hilarious and horrifying, but missed the mark in this adaptation of a postmodern novel about the fear of death. A simple google search about the source material reveals that for years many people felt the story of the novel would not translate to the screen. Those people were right. Credit to the filmmakers for trying, but simply trying does not make an enjoyable movie watching experience for the audience. The film is well cast with big stars and the performances are good, but it hinges on fluid and fast paced often overlapping dialogue that says so much but yet says so little. The film tries too hard to be high art, and maybe it is, maybe psychology classes can examine these characters and dissect every line and find the hidden meaning, but the normal audience will most likely be bored by it all. The film tries to do too many things. Is it a story about an emergency health crisis? Is it a story about a failed marriage? Is it a story about a midlife crisis? Drug addiction? Depression? Anxiety? Infidelity? Why was there a whole segment on Americans fascination with car crashes in movies? I'm sure the novel would be great fodder for a college level class spending a semester examining the themes, but as a two hour movie it just didn't work."
WHITE NOISE,"Can't Really Explain Why I LOVED this film but I did Alright I am just going to say I knew absolutely nothing going in. The film captured me from the very first scene and didn't let go. The style, the statire, the tropes from every last genre of movie! The direction of the scenes down to a Tee. Whoever was in charge of the period sets and styling needs to win something. The supermarket alone is a masterpiece. If you lived in the 70s you will be transported. If you didn't, you will know what it was like.
 Adam Driver, Greta Gerwig, Don Cheadle- all amazing performances.
 I adored this movie and am putting this in my repeat rotation.
 I have to write 15 more words so here we go did I tel you I loved this film?"
WHITE NOISE,"A screenborn toxic event I read a lot of bad reviews here before watching this and still felt sure from the trailer that I'd like it. Nope. If anything, it's worse than the reviews convey: a zany, garish cartoon vision of the '80s that's really nothing like the '80s, with a script that reads like a very bad philosopher or sociologist shoehorning chunks of his thinking into awkward dialogue, and a story that does nothing to carry all that meaning and anyway feels less a story than a series of disconnected, unfunny skits.
 It's all just so shockingly, tediously try-hard bad - everything: dialogue, performances, sets, camera work - all wildly overdone, a sort of perpetual, manic assault that's hopelessly out of keeping with the cool drollery de Lillo seemed to be aiming for in his book.
 So much talent involved and no one piped up before it was too late to say, 'We're making a stinker'? How does this happen? OK, Driver, given his deep commitment to Carax's Annette, seems worryingly like he might be into this kind of blow-hard, faux-comical pretension. And de Lillo has written similarly embarrassing would-be clever dialogue for Cronenberg's Cosmopolis. But Baumbach and Gerwig? They usually judge things well. And Baumbach was actually the screenwriter here and, from what I can recall, de Lillo's novel, while nowhere near as funny as it wants to be, is in no way the series of florid, stagey lunges at profundity Baumbach has turned it into.
 So, I don't know, it's a mystery, but one surely of interest only to film and writing students as an example of what absolutely not to do."
WHITE NOISE,"Don't fault the film The film itself is near perfect. Adam Driver and Greata Gerwig were great. Baumbach is at the top of his directing game. Great performances even from the bit characters, great set production, cinematography, music, pacing....everything is just about perfect. The problem is, is the source material. It is an extremally difficult novel to adapt from. The book, while not long, was a heavy, frantic read that would be hard to translate into a screenplay. In my opinion, Noah did a great job. In face, one of the best novel to film adaptions I've seen so far.
 So if you haven't read the novel, you might be disappointed. If you don't like absurdist comedies, you might be disappointed. If you don't like dry humor, you might be disappointed. So already you can see that the film won't appeal to many, BUT If you have checked all three boxes, than you'll probably enjoy the film."
WHITE NOISE,"Not funny. Not even mildly amusing. Badly OVERacted. A story with no point. I didnt laugh once. I smirked once. That was about it.
 Skip the first 45 minutes. Nothing happens. Then finally after some 45 minutes we get to see some action relieving me from utter boredom. Is the action any good then? NOPE.
 Too many characters. Too disjointed a story. Too gimmicky kind of OVERacting by the 2 leading characters. Oh yes, and several (not so) sublte hints at politically correct themes from todays politics, although this movie was situated in the eighties, which feels odd.
 Not any good then at all? It aint terrible, but it is quite BLAND and tedious.
 I blame the writer. And the director Noah Baumbach. Beware: I ADORED earlier movies by the same director but this story simply had little spark and punch. And with the talent available the director COULD have made something better...
 To be avoided, EVEN for the fans of Adam Driver and Greta Gerwig, because these 2 are some of my favorite actors, BUT unfortunately even they couldnt elevate this movie to some level that didnt make me wanna fall asleep..."
WHITE NOISE,"A bit of a head scratcher As someone who didn't read the book the movie is based on, i will say that i did not connect with this movie or the characters. Am ok with not connecting with characters but the characters in this movie are hard to understand which is odd because they talk and talk (usually at 100 miles an hour and over each other) so you think they would be all out in the open but it was like a wall between them and me. Like i completely failed to understand what it was that the author was saying about the world or the country when he wrote the book. Though i assume that the book was making some sort of commentary about the state of affairs because this movie feels somewhat too large in scale to just be a movie about coming to term with mortality and the difficulties that can arise in a marriage. Like the movie isn't bad but what are you? I will watch it again when it comes out on Netflix to try and see it with fresher eyes but if the purpose of the movie is to frustrate people so much that we rewatch it multiple times, i will say that they will succeed."
WHITE NOISE,Beyond boring dialogue and dialogue and dialogue NO HORROR AT ALL that's a lie!!! 0 First off I hate that when they misrepresent a film I was told comedy drama horror it had NO HORROR and the so called comedy was pompous nobody cares comedy. Nothing relatable in anyway had 1 funny line by Don Cheadle otherwise BORING drama with no payoff at all. Also sorry but with the exception of star wars adam driver is VANILLA very mono tone even his voice is mono tone. The whole film is just a waste we we're going to shut it off but figured it might get better but nope ANOTHER OVERRATED film that 1 person give a glowing review so the lemmings masses follow. It's genre is as such: mundane dialogue filled drama.
WHITE NOISE,"What was that?? What exactly does this film want to achieve? Why should the weird and sometimes paranoid look or angle of a director or script writer be something worth mentioning, let alone made into a movie? I honestly tried to see this movie with as clear a mind as I can... Is there something wrong with me? Is there some secret dimension hidden in this film that I (40 years old) can't grasp? Where is the director looking forward to? Amuse us? Entertain us? Drive us crazy? The last one, he succeeded! What did I watch? A strange, motley family whose members' dialogues use pretentious expressions full of disjointed, meaningless words and a tendency to impress even the teenagers of the family with their knowledge and strange inclinations! Do us a favor... We are not so easy to get. 1/10 from me."
WHITE NOISE,A Bunch of Noise
WHITE NOISE,"Guess Baumbach is just not for me Well, the trailer looked interesting but I guess I just can't stand anything this director does, it just makes me anxious and bored and annoyed at the same time, the unnatural dialogue, overacting and complete lack of momentum in all his films. I understand he has many fans, but all his choices just feel wrong. I also thought Marriage Story was unwatchable and gave up after 15 minutes this one I bailed on after 10. It is like a Woody Allen movie without any humour or likeable characters with only the neurosis and anxiety. I am sure I am missing something, and have nothing against arthouse movies or directors but with NB I just don't feel there is anything there. If you got through any of his other movies then you probably don't have the same allergic reaction to his style of filmmaking."
WHITE NOISE,"A lot to like, and a lot I didn't fully understand I have to admire Noah Baumbach for following up Marriage Story with White Noise. Apart from each starring Adam Driver and centring on a family, the two couldn't be more different. One's a deeply emotional, easy to follow, and very moving family drama, and the other one... well, it's White Noise.
 It's got a premise that's hard to describe. There's a disaster which causes a great deal of panic for much of the film, but it's not the film's entire focus. In some ways, it feels a little like three short films all starring the same characters, and it's a bit hard to figure out how it all connects sometimes.
 The movie reminded me of other wild, unpredictable, all over the place movies in recent years, like Inherent Vice and Under the Silver Lake, but both of those felt like they had more method to their madness, and were consistent with their craziness.
 White Noise definitely isn't bad though. Adam Driver is as great as always, there were some funny parts, and much of the first hour or so is quite exciting. I'd say it's the final 45 minutes that have a few parts that drag, but then again, it builds to a good final scene, so make of that what you will.
 I look forward to seeing what people say when this drops on Netflix (but who knows whether it'll get much attention - it can be hard to predict what will trend). I have no shame in admitting that maybe some of the discussion will help me understand the parts of this film that I didn't quite get from watching it just now.
 (Also, if the Academy Awards don't nominate the LCD Soundsystem song written for this movie for Best Original Song, then they're cowards and/or they have no ears)."
WHITE NOISE,Waste of time
WHITE NOISE,"I gave up after half an hour I knew I'd hate this movie just a couple of minutes into it. Nevertheless, I gave it a chance, but had to succumb after half an hour.
 It's utter drivel. No clear plot seems to emerge, and the acting is completely over the top. The lines are absurd. The 80s setting is kinda amusing at least.
 It should be said that I hated Noah Baumbach's other movies too, so there's probably something about his message that goes over my head.
 Watching it felt much like the train crash that is depicted about half an hour into the proceedings. Disjointed, noisy, arbitrary, dumb. Did I mention noisy?
 Skip this ridiculous waste of time."
WHITE NOISE,"""I'm tentatively scheduled to die."""
THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS,Rushed clumsy b-movie
THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS,"The Matrix Regurgitated I had been holding off from watching The Matrix Resurrections for fear of disappointment, but I eventually took the red pill and went down the rabbit hole, hoping I would party like it was 1999. I hate to say it, but the party is well and truly over: The Matrix Reloaded peed in the punch, and Revolutions made a right royal mess of the bathroom, but Resurrections calls the police, who break down the door and arrest everyone for disturbing the peace. In short, a good time is not had by all.
 Keanu Reeves, sporting his strange half-beard and lank hair, once again plays Neo, who has been resurrected by the machines and plugged back into the Matrix as top games designer Thomas Anderson, famous for his groundbreaking Matrix series (how meta!). Thomas is approached by some alternative types with stupid names and stupid hair who convince him that his life is a lie and extract him from the matrix. After regaining his mojo (kung fu skills and stopping bullets in mid-air), Neo and his new pals attempt to rescue Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), who is still being used as a battery by the machines.
 Part four in the franchise, directed by Lana Wachowski, should have been called The Matrix Regurgitations for it is content to deliver exactly the same kind of nonsense as seen almost two decades ago in Reloaded and Revolutions, namely lots of shooting, lots of fighting, lots of explosions, lots of CGI, and an incomprehensible load of old cyber-crap masquerading as a plot. In short, it's a big case of d√©j√† vu (see what I did there?). Hugo Weaving and Laurence Fishburne had the good sense to stay away from this embarrassing attempt to flog an old horse to death; I bet Christina Ricci and Neil Patrick Harris wish they had followed suit."
THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS,What was this?
THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS,Feels like cheap TV If the SyFy channel made a Matrix series it would look like this. So much about this is way off. The editing and pacing. Shot composition. Fight scenes. Lighting... All of it looks cheap and nasty and that's just the 1st 10 mins.
THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS,Garbage
THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS,"And I Thought ""Reloaded"" and ""Revolutions"" Were Bad"
THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS,"blah blah blah blah Blah blah blah = how much talking and exposition is in this movie. The original matrix had a lot of talking too, but every conversation is intriguing. In this movie, it bored me to death. Almost put me to sleep.
 Blah blah blah = the mess of a story that is this movie. It's all over the place and feels like a bunch of nonsense mashed together.
 Blah blah blah = the unclear and uninspiring action. The fight scenes in the first two movie are amongst the best ever put to screen, including Asian cinema. The action in Reloaded is incredible. In this movie, it just feels like action vomit all over the screen. It ranges from mediocre to bad. And only one part is memorable (certain things are falling onto the street). The fight scenes suffer from close ups and quick cuts, something we never see in the originals.
 The more I think about it, a 4 star rating seems generous. But that's how I felt leaving the theater. There is some good here. But I don't think I'd bother giving it another chance. (1 viewing, 12/23/2021)"
THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS,"Felt like a sequel to ""Battlefield Earth"" rather then ""Matrix"" Greetings from Lithuania.
 ""The Matrix"" (1999) is in my TOP 3 movies of all time. I was a teenager when it came out and i basically grew up with it. I liked ""Reloaded"" and even ""Revolutions"" was pretty OK movie.
 Cut to almost 20 years later and we have ""The Matrix Resurrections"" (2021). I was exited after the amazing trailer, yet the track record of movies that Wachowski made after ""Revolutions"" was not giving many hopes. And after seeing latest one on a premier day just now i can say that ""Resurrections"" is the worst movie I've seen in many moons, unfortunately. It was excruciatingly bad.
 Story was a mess. Writing was horrible. It was so poorly written that audience was started to laugh at things that were not supposed to be funny. Directing was terrible. The only good thing in this disaster was Jessica Henwick's acting - she was good. And Keanu Reeves just sleepwalked trough the whole thing.
 Overall, ""Resurrections"" felt like a parody of the original trilogy - i kid you not. You have to see by yourself Jada Pinkett Smith's Niobe to believe it - and i will say nothing more. It literally felt like a sequel to ""Battlefield Earth"" (2000) rather to one of the best films ever made. On the other hand - in its 2 h 20 min run time it wasn't boring - with my broken heart i can safely say that ""The Matrix Resurrections"" was so bad that it was actually fun to watch. One day thins might become a cult classic, but not in a good way.
 Terrible movie in every single possible way."
THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS,"The Matrix Retreading Laughingly bad. Filled with loads of ""Remember this?"" flashbacks and obnoxious slow-mo and blur. Dull and confusing story, dumb dialogue, and crap action sequences you won't remember at all. Another rehash stinker. Just a quick cash-grab and all the talent from the original Matrix trilogy is gone and left with a movie that wasn't needed in the first place.
 3/10."
THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS,Why was that movie even made?
THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS,"Mediocre Is Not Good Enough Back then the first Matrix movie was a revelation, for sure one of the best movies made in the 90s. I also liked the sequels a lot - despite some flaws here and there. Anyway, The Matrix Resurrections is what I expected and feared - a very mediocre movie compared to the original trilogy. Who needs this one? Why was it even made - the story was told and Resurrections adds nothing really new or any good. Like that new Resident Evil fail, this one I watched once and I will most likely never put on a screen again: I will take the blue pill and forget its existence..."
THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS,"Disappointing! Strictly a Money Grab Movie! I've been waiting for this one with anticipation and I was thoroughly disappointed. I spent the first 40 minutes wondering what was going on. It was barely coherent. The rest of the movie got slightly better. But there was no real story. Some parts were enjoyable. Some weren't. But, at the end, I didn't feel like my day had been enriched by watching it and I have no desire to watch it again. The original Matrix, on the other hand, I still watch that at least once a year. This movie was done strictly as a money grab. There was no real story to tell and no journey to follow. I don't recommend it!"
THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS,"Made me nauseous I had a horrible feeling 2 minutes into the film it was going to be bad. The film is very off. No Morpheus no Matrix and what is with the incessant need to show clips from the original film every minute like we don't know what they are referring to.
 It feels like they made this to a younger audience who have never heard of The Matrix and needed reminding with the constant references to the first.
 I feel sick."
THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS,"No comment, really, seriously, no comment . . ."
THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS,"This Matrix feels like a Fairy tale... The three previous Matrix, you could sense the fear the humans had when entering the Matrix or interactions with the machines. These new characters treated it like it was their neighborhood playground and had no worries of death. It was laughable!... I said characters because I actually don't even remember none of their names."
THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS,It's hard to figure out what's the purpose here
THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS,"Surprisingly awful The original Matrix is an absolute classic (9/10). The two sequels were good (6 or 7/10) but with pretty confusing storylines in parts.
 This film is truly dreadful. Surprisingly awful in fact.
 The trailor takes tiny snapshots of the film and make it look like a fantastic blockbuster, but in reality it is a nostalgia-heavy, poorly thought out and terribly acted 'remake' of sorts of the first film.
 The storyline and the number of pointless easter eggs/repeats of the first film make this a largely pointless addition to the original trilogy.
 Save your money or go and see Spiderman instead ü§£"
THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS,"I don't like new characters. Morpheus was a smart, profound man who left the impression of a kung fu monk. This new one is an antipathetic character that I wouldn't follow anywhere, even if my own life depends on it.
 These new characters they did don't inspire and don't have that intellectual depth. The only thing good about this film are the moments of fights, CGI, and of course, it's nice to see Niobe, Trinity, and Neo.
 However, when you get to The Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) speech or to The Analyst (Patrick Haris), you come back to IMDB and edit your rating from ""terrible"" to ""hm, ok"".
 Haha :D The song from credits. My God, this modern-day society killed everything. This is embarrassing."
THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS,WOW!! What a dud
THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS,"What a disappointment. This is so cheap that they basically remade the first film yet made it also a sequel at the same time. The majority of the film has the same structure as the first film and most scenes are exactly the same just altered...
 The good thing is that CGI is very high quality, but at the same time action scenes feel so generic and uninspired, way inferior to the original film, I admit a few moments were cool, but most action not only feel weak but poorly executed like fights feel like they were made by people who don't know how to fight so they just try to imitate what fighting supposed to look like from what they've seen somewhere else.
 Music is trying real hard to imitate the soundtrack of original films yet feels weaker and more like rip-offs than remixes or remakes of old tracks.
 What's up with all the references and literally showing footage from previous films? Do they think we have forgotten the films completely? But the insulting part is that film acknowledges that it references itself to the point that it literally tells that fact a few times - as a joke? I guess, sort of breaking the 4th wall but not really I guess. It's just so lame.
 There are also so many embarrassing scenes, I laughed so hard at some of the stuff that if this film isn't meme material - I don't know what is then.
 Also, many of the returning characters often feel completely out of character, and I despise how they treated most characters that do not return for this film. It feels like that Matrix parody by CollegeHumor.
 Most importantly this feels very long (and it is), yet it shows almost nothing cool, most of it just replicates the first film also making it somehow longer yet worse in every way with the only exception being a much better CGI. It's such a shame that such uninspired sequels like this exist."
THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS,"Mind-bendingly Terrible Truly unbelievable they had the nerve to release this. They re-enact the majority of scenes from the trilogy, primarily the original movie, and also physically show footage of the original numerous times. Pathetic, it really is pathetic. I'm tired of this repetitive mediocre garbage with seemingly every new movie of the past 5 or so years, the lack of effort and quality is beyond sad. I barely go to the cinema anymore as of a few years ago due to total nonsense being on, and I think this was my last cinema visit ever unless I can be sure it's even remotely worth the money."
THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS,"There's a reason why we don't resurrect the dead. I remember seeing the Matrix in the cinema as a young kid and it blew my mind. It was the essence of cool, combining a then unfamiliar Hong Kong aesthetic with cutting edge special effects, heady themes, and of course bringing bullet time to the forefront of modern cinema. Visually it was soo revolutionary that the 2003 sequels were never able to recapture that impact, and this sequel is no exception.
 Nowadays there isn't a single superhero movie that hasn't been built on the Matrix's special effects and evolved it to such a level that Resurrections would have truly have had to have been unique to have the same impact as the original, which is something that I doubt anyone was expecting, so all I was asking for was a solid, well thought out, storyline. And that sadly is something that Resurrection does not have. Hell, half of the movie seems to just be footage from the first three movies, one quarter is millennial characters moaning about millennial issues, and one quarter seems to be new, albeit pointless, content.
 I can see why Hugo, after reading the script, turned down the chance to reprise his Agent Smith role. I would have done the same if I'd have read the script too. And casting Neil Patrick Harris as a villain? He was so miscast that he was comically bad; I genuinely felt embarrassed for him and his performance. Keanu too, sadly, put it a terrible performance, arguable the worst of his career, and Carrie-Anne Moss was clearly just walking in her performance. Jessica Henwick seemed to be about the only one who could be bothered to act in this movie but sadly her storyline was just as dull as the rest of the movie.
 Morpheus once said that unfortunately no-one can be told what the Matrix is, you have to see it for yourself. Well I'm telling you now that you do not need to see the movie to know that it's bad. Sometimes you should just leave sleeping dogs lie."
THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS,"The Matrix should have stayed a trilogy. Aside from the action scenes and a few throwback moments, this film is a misfire on many levels. It just doesn't have the feel of a Matrix film at all. Just some cool visual effects, decent action and a bit of uniqueness is what this unnecessary sequel is watchable for one time.
 It's not boring but also doesn't justify the length. The sad part is, the non-action or the dialogue parts don't have any excitement or energy at all. Watching them is almost a chore, while the action set-pieces hold your attention with the style and presentation. The actors did good, and that's something I can't deny.
 All in all, this feels more like a direct-to-video sequel made to cash in on the original franchise. Resurrections isn't really bad: it's watchable, but has its limitations. Keep your expectations in check before you watch this and you might find a good time-pass action flick for the evening. That's all there is to it. The Matrix should have stayed a trilogy, but a new film is welcome for a singular viewing experience nonetheless."
THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS,"A sad remake of itself So what if you could remake the original Matrix film, but this time without the big reveal of what the Matrix is and add a twist that tries to explain why you could do that? It's like an idea you joke around about but not actually make into a film that you've made before. And in typical Hollywood fashion, they remake the same thing but just bigger, flashier, with things they think are even cooler, - and results in something so much dumber. Things in this Matrix don't need to make sense provided they look cool, which is all that matters.
 This Matrix should have stayed dead. Action? No, not really, at least not for a very large part of it - and the kung fu actually sucks. This is The Matrix: A Love Story. But this time, with just cooler looking characters and mumbo jumbo that explains the technology stuff in a way that doesn't make sense to us people but it does to the actors, who nod their heads and smile as if they really know what that techno gobbledygook means.
 ""Wow, this code is freaky!!!!"" one actor says in excitement! LOL, the film becomes a parody of itself, along with replacement actors who can't help but try their best to mimic the iconic performances of a cast that happened to have been cast perfectly. My single word review of this tripe is the replacement phrase for ""whoa!!!"" that was in the original film. ""Fuuuuuuuu*****!"" See it if you're curious. But it's big, dumb and a useless grab at the franchise cash register."
THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS,"BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! Utter rubbish. In the first few minutes I already knew that this movie would disrespect and soil the Matrix legacy (and frankly, the last one really toed the line).
 Garbage plot, garbage directing, no Morpheus, garbage effects. Felt cheaply done. What were they thinking? This movie has no business bearing the ""The Matrix'"" moniker. The ending alone should have made someone stop and ask ""is this dumb af or is it just me?""
 Bottom line? We deserved better than this.
 Keanu, if you read this I hope you know that I'm still a huge fan. Your acting was terrible but I forgive you."
HELLRAISER,Unneeded remake
HELLRAISER,"Bad I didn't expect this from David Bruckner. I loved The Ritual and The Night House and I was expecting something spectacular from this reboot. But I didn't liked this one at all and it actually annoyed and depressed me. Unlikable characters, cast, bland and irritating performances (Odessa A'zion's performance was infuriating and exhausting), slow pacing, poorly written dialogues and story; overall another disappointing Hellraiser installment.
 The trailer was great but the film was outrageous. Even the Cenobites failed to display any kind of personality or intimidation. They all looked, especially Pinhead, very rubbery and dull."
HELLRAISER,Disappointing For Hellraiser Fans
HELLRAISER,"Total Failure I guess one should appreciate the fact that they didn't try to make a scene-by-scene remake of the original but that's about the only positive thing I have to say about this movie because it's a total failure.
 The plot has nothing to do with the original movie. It's basically yet another sequel, with Pinhead replaced (again) by a new actor (this time an actress).
 The first half of the movie is a borefest and the second half is just a mess. All the atmosphere of the original movie is just gone. Cinematography is basic and there is almost lack of music (except for hints and tiny cues of Christopher Young's original and superb score). The Cenobites are simple, non-scary and appear like a cheap TV movie.
 The pacing is just awful and the plot is boring. By the time Pinhead finally appears - after more than an hour into the movie - I was already bored and from there it just got worse and I couldn't wait for it to be over.
 I have no idea why people praise this movie so much. For me it was yet another failed and boring sequel.
 Don't waste your time on this. Better rewatch the original or the first sequel instead."
HELLRAISER,"Hell. Didn't Even Raise the Bar Looking back at what made the original so good was how off putting it was , dark and very original.
 The source material being the same we wouldn't expect much new .
 Where this outing fails is to raise the bar on what made the original so good.
 The tension and build up is ok but I felt disappointed with the costumes. To me the heavy layered latex looked like heavy layered latex. The original was a darker filmed movie and the Cenobites were so disturbing the first time you see them . In this newer version we have a wider field of view shot further away and it looses its claustrophobic feel . Escaping seems easier and that drives the tension down.
 So different cinematography and poor customers and such take away .
 The good is the protagonist the actor does a good job portraying seemly troubled youth .
 Act 3 has a bit of a twist but comes too late in the film to save it."
HELLRAISER,"Watch Hellraiser 1,2,3 and 4. Stop there and thank me later. The first Hellraiser was historic and marked a new era in horror movies. The film made Clive Barker a household name. The legendary author Stephen King having remarked, ""I have seen the future of horror. His name is Clive Barker"".
 But after this and a few cult horror offerings like Nightbreed and Lord Of Illusions, Barker has since disappeared into obscurity. Hellraiser remains my favorite Cliver Barker horror film because of his first attempt at directing a horror film by himself. The transition from writer to director is not easy and very difficult. Barker proved his critics wrong. Hellraiser was a resounding success and spawned subsequent sequels. In my opinion, only the first four Hellraiser films are coherent and worth watching. They make a complete quadrilogy.
 Hellraiser was the first film to incorporate Cenobites, referred to as, ""demons to some, angels to others"". The head Cenobite was a character called Pinhead, his name derived from his bald head studded with nails. He was played by actor Doug Bradley, whose acting and voice-acting of Pinhead in particular I'm very fond of. Doug tried to appear in as many Hellraiser sequels - but not all. Without his great contribution, Hellraiser would have no roots at all.
 Back to this film. All Hellraiser films deal with the opening of a puzzle box(like Pandora's box) and unleashing hell(the Cenobites). This one follows the same pattern. A collector Roland Voight acquires the puzzle box(also called the Lemarchand Configuration, created by the French toymaker Philip Lemarchand for Duc de L'Isle an occultist). The story of the origin of the box is shown in Hellraiser part 4 called Hellraiser: Bloodlines. Voight tells a sex worker called Joey to solve the box. Joey solves the configuration and is stabbed by a blade hidden inside the box. A portal opens, from which chains fly out and rip Joey apart, as Voight demands an audience with Leviathan.
 Six years later, recovering addict Riley is living with her brother Matt, his boyfriend Colin, and their roommate Nora. Riley's boyfriend, Trevor, convinces her to help break into an abandoned storage warehouse, where they discover the puzzle box. Returning home late, Riley gets into an argument with Matt and leaves. At an empty park, she solves the box but avoids being cut by the blade. The Cenobites, a group of deformed humanoids, appear and demand she choose another as sacrifice. Matt finds Riley blacked out and, as he tries to wake her up, inadvertently cuts himself on the box. He goes to a nearby restroom to clean his wound. Riley hears him scream and discovers that he has vanished. The rest of the film deals with Riley's quest to find her missing brother.
 Verdict: if you've seen the first four films, don't expect good acting like the previous installments. The actors are soulless(pun intended), talent-less and inexperienced. There is no notable veteran among the lot of them. Doug Bradley could have been given a role in this film. The special effects are okay but not outstanding given today's overuse of C. G. I. Photography is above average and the background sound-effects are decent. The director tries to make the best with the script given to him. I don't blame the director but the people who conceived the idea of this bland reboot.
 More Clive Barker films: Underworld 1985(directed by George Pavlou), Rawhead Rex 1986(also directed by George Pavlou), Candyman 1992(directed by Bernard Rose), The Midnight Meat Train 2008(directed by Ryuhei Kitamura), Book of Blood 2009(directed by John Harrison).
 Thanks for reading this review!"
HELLRAISER,"Fails on almost every level I'm old enough to remember the original Hellraiser (1987). That was a true horror film. There were horrible people, doing horrible things. It left you feeling really quite disturbed about the worst aspect of human nature.
 The follow-up Hellraiser 2 (1988) managed to recapture a small part of that. But after that it was downhill fast. The sequels were nothing but parodies.
 Well, for some reason, Hulu decided to remake it.
 Shamefully, the film fails on nearly every level. It's not well written (terrible dialogue) and poorly acted. There's little horror and you simply do not care about anyone or anything happening in it. It doesn't give you a reason to care either.
 Like the later Hellraiser films It has more in common with trashy slasher flicks than anything else. Poorly done ones at that.
 As is common today they gender-switched the main role. Did it add anything? Nope.
 Watch Hellraiser (1987) and Hellraiser 2 (1988) and stop there. They did it better on much smaller budgets."
HELLRAISER,"Poor remake A young woman, Riley, discovers an ancient box in a park. The box unleashes the Cenobites, a group of ghoulish semi-human figures, who demand a sacrifice. Her brother Matt unwittingly becomes that sacrifice when he cuts himself on the box.
 I'm not a horror fan at all but liked the original Hellraiser, released in 1987 and directed by a master of the genre, Clive Barker. Quite original, especially by horror standards (where the bar is set incredibly low).
 This is nothing like that. Quite dull, clich√©d and predictable, poorly written, directed, acted and produced. Fairly unengaging as none of the characters are particularly likeable. The whole dark-is-arty aesthetic is incredibly annoying and seems like a way for the director to censor his own horror scenes.
 Avoid."
HELLRAISER,"Lamentable configuration College kids get chased around the woods by Cenobites. Cenobites lay siege to those kids in a mansion. It's like the zombie formula, but with Cenobites.
 All of which makes the Cenobites feel pretty ineffectual. Never mind that Cenobites getting locked out of a house isn't really in keeping with, you know, opening all those portals from other dimensions in the walls and floor. Maybe it's a magic house, I don't know.
 The Hellraiser reboot has decent art direction. It has a budget. There's nothing wrong with the new Pinhead, she's fine. But in terms of story, they phoned it in this time. We're left with a movie that's perfectly acceptable as some time-waster slasher that you forget the moment the credits roll, but that's all. Lamentable, considering the potential."
HELLRAISER,"What is this? I've been seeing a lot of positive reviews on this film and thought I'd give it a watch but did I just watch the same film some of the critics have watched?
 This film is abysmal, it's cheap looking, poorly acted, boring as hell.
 The make up effects on the new Pinhead are awful, it just doesn't look right at all, there's too many pins crammed into the face of the actress and it almost looks like a cosplay outfit.
 There are some pretty neat looking practical effects in this one although there are some awful ones as well, it is gory but then you'd expect that from a Hellraiser movie, it's dark and broody but some of the scenes are so dark you can barely make out what's going on. It has an ok soundtrack but the lore and the box (the Lament configuration if I've spelt that correctly) have been changed and made way worse IMO
 This isn't a patch on the first 2 Hellraiser films and anyone who claims otherwise is no true Hellraiser fan, I'd go as far as to say parts 3 and 4 were better as well.
 Is it better than the last 3 or 4 Hellraiser movies to come out, yes but that's not difficult as some of those were absolutely abysmal. This one has some improvements over those but for all the hype this thing is getting, it's a massive disappointment.
 There's only one Pinhead and he is Doug Bradley, it's been proven time and again that anyone else playing this role is an inferior version of a once great horror movie villain, Jamie Clayton here is no different, her performance is awful and she's as much Pinhead as I am Jason Momoa. She lacks any screen presence and is as wooden as the last 2 guys that played the role.
 Avoid!"
HELLRAISER,"Vanilla Hell They turned Hellraiser into a vanilla Freddy Krueger inspired slasher, which makes for a very watchable if unmemorable experience.
 Some of the ideas, even if borrowed, were convincing : the mansion, the dumb rules, the drug allegory. And some true Hellraiser concepts and visuals like the Leviathan moment were particularly well done but no spoilers here.
 The most disappointing was probably the Cenobites design way too elegant and Alien like, not gruesome or surreal enough. Plus the characters deaths felt like generic gory horror √† la SAW or Escape Room. It was missing a sense of spectacle and boldness despite having clearly a decent budget.
 Still an enjoyable movie."
HELLRAISER,"Any other sequel without Clive Barker directing / writing is a waste of time. Lets face it. Any other sequel without Clive Barker directing / writing is a waste of time. Period.
 After seeing ""The Nighthouse"" i already knew that this director wouldn't be able to pull a Hellraiser movie off. But direction isn't the only thing that disappointed here. The writing was poor. The characters were unlikable to the point where you don't really care what happens to them. Like the expendable cast of any slasher movie / meets Hellraiser.
 The story here didn't offer anything new beyond the core themes established by Clive Barker. The Soundtrack of Hellraiser 2022 didn't either.
 Add poor story progression, absurd dialogues and general lack of inspiration, and you end up with this turd.
 The only thing that was somewhat positive was the convincing production / creature design. Too bad everything else sucked. Better luck next time!"
HELLRAISER,"Convoluted and sterile nonsense with bad CGI This is a reboot for the modern age. The controverial sexual undertones and relious themes of the original are done away with, leaving only some visual ingredients to be repurosed into a teen horror film.
 Instead of a seemingly normal family with conflicts and dark secrets festering below the surface, we instead get a bunch of mid 20s good for nothings who spend half the movie screaming at each other instead of communicating intelligently.
 We also get generic corporate type white man bad villain and androgynous Pinhead.
 I always hate when films present their characters with video game like ""quests"".
 As in ""collect x number of sacrificial people to have your wish granted"".
 It's the least interesting excuse to go around butchering a specific numebr of people, with only the last intended victim and least likely hero to turn the cards and win the day.
 Predictably, that's what happens here. It's a HULU / Disney producton after all. What did you expect, good writing?
 As we've come to expect from Disney, the CGI is terrible. However, some of the new Cenobite Designs are legitimately cool and creepy. If nothing else, that almost makes this worth watching. Almost.
 I recommend sticking to the original, possibly part 2 and definitely part 5. Those had more interesting themes, better designs, far better performances and coherent plots (1 and 5 that is)."
HELLRAISER,"I Have Seen the Future of Horror...and This Is Not It David Bruckner blew me away last year with his artful piece of horror, The Night House, but he forsakes that type of intricate horror voyage to attempt a reimagining of an 80's horror staple, Hellraiser. Odessa A'zion was a naturally charismatic lead, and the relationship she shared with her brother was engaging enough, but the grittiness that I so enjoyed in Clive Barker's film was nowhere to be found. Bruckner's polished aesthetic clashed with the moral quandary of the distinction between pain and pleasure. It's hard to believe that the visual effects, particularly practical effects, were better 35 years ago, but I truly think that's an irrefutable statement in this case. The original Hellraiser had only four credited visual effects specialists, but they were all undeniably essential in making Hellraiser one of the most visually unnerving films of the 1980s. They increased that department roughly tenfold in this one, compromising some of the uniformity and personality along the way. They also oddly determined that the remake should be nearly 30 minutes longer, but struggled to include enough innovation to warrant that runtime. One of the film's biggest downfalls, though, was the casting of Pinhead. In the original, Pinhead's booming voice and assertive presence created an inescapable feeling of intimidation. But in the 2022 film, Pinhead fails to command the screen as well as Doug Bradley did in 1987. Apart from trying to be as progressive as possible, I can't begin to understand the reasoning behind that decision. It's a bummer that a brilliant concept like Hellraiser was squandered on such a forgettable piece of filmmaking."
HELLRAISER,Don't believe the rating
HELLRAISER,"Tame & Lame I did not make it to the end - too tame, too lame. Like other reviewers put up the question, I gotta do it too - why even bother making this movie? The production is okay, that's the only reason why I didn't rate this one a straight one. Like Rob Zombie's The Munsters, this Hellraiser too has no heart, no soul - so just making movies for the sake of making movies and making some money? Anyway, I like the first two Hellraiser movies, some of the others have at least a little power by the art of cheese, but this one tastes very stale. Verdict: low score on the horror-o-meter, low score on the cheese-o-meter, this one belongs rightfully into the domain of the forgotten ones."
HELLRAISER,"Old Dog, Old Box of Tricks... There's a box that plays tricks with your mind, it's most often extremely unkind, opens doors to hells chasms, will leave your nerves spasmed, as your skin peels away and untwines.
 You've seen it all before, and probably enjoyed it more (but only if it was the first one as the rest were exponentially awful), as two hours does become quite a chore, and may leave you sore, but not as sore as if you'd been scored by a sharp knife and had all your dermis demolished and diminished to nothing. More likely you'll spend most of the time wondering if you would make the same poor decisions as those who deserved just about all they got from the ones they made, and some."
HELLRAISER,"Well Hulu and Disney is part of it. A travesty by itself... Only watched the intro but couldnt bare to watch further because of the dreadfully talentless trendvictimized urbanised hipster cast and bad dialogue.
 So lets be frank, yet another Hellraiser movie has been destroyed by producers and directors, and this time theyre part of the PC hipster v**us elite of hollywood. Gee, not that surprised really in this modern age of lack of substance remakes...
 Clive Barker and Doug Bradley should be embarrassed by this pile of f**th (which they apparently arent, instead these pop cultured pr**titutes that used to be my horror heroes seem to praise it...)
 To conclude, I know Im not alone among its genuine fanbase feeling pi**ed off that no one seem to care and create a decent storytelling and honour the roots of the Hellraiser universe. It seems that its doomed to be a failed franchise after the third movie."
HELLRAISER,"Disappointing is an understatement... I had high hopes for this movie. I welcomed a twist to Pinhead and co-horts but in the end, the film did not have the mood or overall creepiness as in original classic.
 Loved the rawness of the the original film. In this iteration, it's slick and antiseptic. Nothing seemed creepy, scary or visceral.
 When the gang arrives, they didn't have a presence. In the original, the scene and mood change with their appearance. Basically in this it looked like women dressed in Halloween costumes. Nothing frightening. Even in all the 'gory' scenes, the blood and imagery looked plastic and not realistic.
 I loved the first time I watched the original Hellraiser in theaters. There is none of the suspense and horror here. Nothing. Have to say this is movie is much better than the last Hellraiser movie (Hellraiser: Judgement), which is not saying much.
 Just watch the original and classic Hellraiser again and skip this one. Unless you want to get your nap time in."
HELLRAISER,"What did i just watch? I fell asleep and didnt want to finish it but did. This was really pointless, boring, way to long, bad acting, and worthless. The cenebites were more like robot Aliens and screwed up the lore of all the movies. You didnt care for any of the actors and wished they all died a bad death but the movie didnt show that. It was tame and not scary at all and not even dread was created. It's not a reimagining but a really bad bad remake. I'd rather watch the CD in his face guy from the 3rd one. The sex scenes were really out of place and weird as well. Of course they set it up to continue but its way to boring for a Part 2."
HELLRAISER,N/A
HELLRAISER,"What was the point? This adaptation is all over the place and has no solid plot. It's mostly filmed in really dark lighting and is nowhere near as good as the original. It doesn't come close or even compare. This movie is more about a selfish girl struggling with addiction, and too dumb to understand the difference between right and wrong and when to just walk away from a bad situation.
 They should have just left the original Hellraiser alone because that's an unmatched classic horror film, that actually makes sense. That film has horrifyingly gruesome and gory scenes that really creep you out. This version was mediocre at best."
HELLRAISER,"We'll Tear Your Script Apart Hellraiser 2022 is a poor movie at best. It's a bunch of pointless tropes clumsily hammered into a continuation of the Hellraiser brand.
 As per usual, the overly obvious script was spawned by the atrocious, David S Goyer, AKA the Destroyer of Brands.
 HOW does this man keep getting work? He knows no subtlety or sophistication. His scripts are just awful, and this is no exception. If you analyse any part of the script, it's just BAD. Really, go do it.
 Utterly unlikeable characters, there's nothing to relate to, here. An addict in recovery - well that sure is fascinating, David! And they all make such bizarre choices. Dialogue is as per usual, awful.
 But it's not all on Goyer's shoulders. The new Cenobites are not a patch on the originals, and the art design is just odd. They don't feel scary although everything in the movie is demanding that you be scared of them.
 The music is still excellent, the whole 2 hours feels overly long and missing anything of depth or substance.
 There's no emotional connection so you don't care about any of them. And the main character's choices are just bizarre, especially in the third act.
 In closing, there are a few scraps here that make H2022 palatable, but it's a far cry from the greatness of the original two movies. It's just another pointless remake that could have benefitted from a competent writer that didn't rely on the most obvious tropes to hammer home the same tired points.
 3/10. Must do better."
HELLRAISER,"It's not a terrible horror movie but it IS a bad Hellraiser movie At its core, the original Hellraiser (1987) was a story about the darkest, sordid recess of human nature. It was about desire and lust, possession and betrayal and how these powerful, very human feelings can push people on the brink of inhumane horror.
 It was - at the same time - also a story of lovecraftian cosmic horror, where the characters face a terror so powerful and behond human comprehension that defeat was inevitable. All things considered, it was a truly nihilistic and dark statement on human nature.
 The somewhat-superior-somewhat-inferior sequel - Hellboud: Hellraiser II (1988) - dealt with the consequences of such horror, with the obsession derived from it, with madness and will, with power and seduction.
 Both movies had thematic layers and depth and the horror, the cenobites, the lore were just tools and background to tell these deeply nihilistic stories about the horrors that lies in the depths of human nature.
 From there on out, the franchise went off the rails, piling up inferior movie after inferior movie. The reason of this debacle is that the producers made the horrible mistake of thinking that the lore (the cenobites, the box/the Lament configuration and so on) were actually the point.
 Which brings us to THIS movie. After a brief, shallow and bland characters introduction, the entire focus of the story starts revolving around the box, cenobites and all that stuff, in the same shallow, bland way the characters were presented.
 It isn't even interesting from a lore perspective: at least, the otherwise abysmal Hellraiser: Judgement (2018) gave some juicy bits of new, fascinating lore. Here it's just the same ol' same old except it's more incoherent than in previous installments to the point where almost nothing makes sense.
 Eventually, the whole movie became a run of the mill slasher, with cenobites chasing empty characters in the woods. There are no themes in sight, nothing is said about human nature , no layers, no depth. Sure, its gory but its lifeless and, what's worse for an Hellraiser installment, its meatless. Flesh-less.
 Clayton's performance as the new Hell Priest/Pinhead is interesting and works perfectly fine. It does not compare with Doug Bradley's, but it doesn't have to.
 Everything else is just bland and lifeless - which is too bad, considering the other movies in this director's filmography were pretty great, subtle and smart - and there is clearly an attempt at going in the right direction, with lots of practical effects, gorgeus set design and some attention to details: it really smells as if the failing are on the studio/the producers."
HELLRAISER,"Foolishly follows the formula of the worst sequels. Too much pointless story. Not enough Pinhead and hell. I find it odd that people are losing attention spans yet movies are getting slower and slower to getting to their point.
 The original Hellraiser was like an exciting and very creative visual unfolding of hell. It SHOWED you the journey instead of telling you. It took place inside a good man's home who had a loving and strong relationship with his daughter. It made us care and relate.
 It made you feel like you were inside its hellish world.
 The reboot is like someone overly talking and explaining Hellraiser to you until you become bored and don't even care anymore. It takes place in many locations around a lazy junkie type girl who we don't care about.
 This one makes you feel like an outsider just hearing about its world.
 When did movies forget that they are a mainly a visual medium that require more well-rounded people that most of us can grab onto?"
ETERNALS,"Dire. I've read several critical reviews applauding this film, however having sat through it twice I have to point out that this is a very poor film.
 Almost two and a half hours long, and every single minute of this film was an effort. How on Earth did they think this would appeal?
 It's a lifeless watch, it rambles along at a torturous pace, and sadly half the cast seem totally disinterested, giving very wooden performances.
 Special effects vary, some look good, some look very poor, when you look at the budget this film had, it should have looked flawless, it doesn't.
 I love Gemma Chan and Richard Madden, but neither of them look totally at home here, I only hope this turkey of a movie doesn't halt either career.
 I don't think a second will follow somehow.
 Awful sadly, I did give it a second watch to be sure, but there you are, it's a shocker, 3/10."
ETERNALS,"Watching this movie felt like an eternity Shang-Chi gave me hope for Phase 4 of Marvel. Eternals dashed those hopes. This is probably my least favorite Marvel movie. This film is too long and crammed full of overly complicated plot points, yet it's also completely predictable. It seems the filmmakers were too busy trying to check off boxes rather than create a good story. It's also a downer. People watch MCU movies to have fun, not to have existential crises. Perhaps the Eternals should have stood on the sidelines a little longer."
ETERNALS,"Fairly shallow Marvel experience... Another year, another Marvel Studios superhero movie, right? Well, so it would seem. I had only vaguely heard about ""Eternals"" prior to sitting down to watch it. But then again, superhero movies isn't exactly my primary go-to-movie choice. But yeah, I do watch them if given the chance, as Marvel Studios does churn out movies that are fun enough if for nothing else then for the amazing CGI.
 And that was the case with the 2021 movie ""Eternals"" from writers Chlo√© Zhao, Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo and Kaz Firpo. This movie was all flash and bang and no proper contents. It was all essentially just pointless eye-candy.
 For me, then we are talking about a swing and a miss for Marvel Studios with the 2021 superhero movie ""Eternals"". When the movie ended, I was left with an overwhelming sensation of 'what did I just waste two and a half hours on watching?'. And I was also left with a sense of none of the characters portrayed in the story had any significance or backstory. You might as well replace them with mannequins and still end up with the same movie result.
 You would assume that with a cast ensemble that included the likes of Gemma Chan, Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington and Lauren Ridloff among others, that you would be in for a stellar movie experience. But nay, director Chlo√© Zhao didn't rise to the occasion to deliver a wholesome and entertaining superhero movie. Nope, this was a lukewarm movie at best.
 The total absence of properly written characters and character development throughout the two and a half hours of runtime was just atrocious to witness. And it totally turned the movie into a shallow experience. Yet, I managed to sit through it, but believe you me, this is not a movie that I will ever be returning to watch a second time. There were so many characters to keep track off, yet none of them had any properly written backstory, character traits, personalities or anything, so they just sort of blended into one singular faceless mass. And hence, I didn't care one bit about any of the hero characters, because they were about as interesting as mannequins.
 ""Eternals"" was pure and simply just eye-candy in term of entertainment value. The storyline would have been more interesting if the story had interesting characters, subplots, etc., but there was no such thing going on here.
 Sure, I am by no account a fan of the superhero genre, but watch the movie regardless, but ""Eternals"" was definitely among the top contenders for being among the most pointless and boring of superhero movies.
 My rating of ""Eternals"" lands on a three out of ten stars."
ETERNALS,hard to connect
ETERNALS,"Eternal was the Runtime I'm not going to give a long winded review though the movie was long. ""Eternal"" was the runtime. There were parts that were good and parts that weren't. One of the biggest issues is that a movie of this nature presents more questions than it answers. The very existence of eternal beings existing on planet Earth, sent there by their creator in order to protect human life from Deviants, begs a lot of questions. And the more they strayed from their prime directive, the more questions they presented. The eternals were human in every aspect with the exception of their powers and their lifespan. The fact that such humanlike and very fallible beings (as in not entirely obedient) were sent to protect humans is just a start of the questions.
 ""Eternals"" was unnecessarily long. There were plenty of scenes that could've been left on the cutting room floor. Marvel bit off a lot with this metaphysical, beginning of creation movie. It was very emotional and slow at many points. Even the comic relief failed to garner the laughs it intended. But, there was applause in the theater after it was over. Honestly, I don't know if that was based upon how good the movie was or simply MCU diehards paying their obligatory tribute."
ETERNALS,Definitely my #1 Worst Movie of the Year!
ETERNALS,Neither Intrigues Nor Entertains
ETERNALS,"i'm so sad I went in knowing nothing about the source material and not watching a single trailer. I had no expectations for this movie. After watching it, I feel like it had the potential to be incredible. But it wasn't. It wasn't even good. I'm legitimately sad while writing this.
 I see this as the MCU homage to Watchmen. It feels very ""adult"" in so many ways. But in others, it's childish. The story is a complete mess. So many useless side plots. The characters feel flat, especially the protagonist. Some uncharacteristically bad casting choices (while also criminally under utilizing Angelina Jolie, a beast of an actress, should have been the main character). So much of this movie doesn't feel natural, something always feels a bit off.
 There's a lot i enjoyed. I watched some of the coolest things I've ever seen on screen. So many parts are visually stunning. Some of the action was good, some wasn't. An enormous step down in that department after Shang-Chi. The deep philosophical themes were interesting but poorly executed.
 Sigh. I'll probably watch it again to see if it grows on me. But this might be the worst MCU movie.
 Edit: I watched it again, in IMAX of course. I enjoyed it a lot more the second time. All of my initial flaws are still there. But I focused on all of the good, and tried to ignore the bad. It made for a much better experience, especially after moving past the initial disappointment of how truly amazing it could have been.
 I think the reason I found the protagonist so underwhelming is because she doesn't drive the plot. Her character is always reactive. Things happen to her. She's generally likeable, but a weak character. And one thing that was impossible to ignore even when I tried, Salma Hayek was a terrible choice.
 My favorite character is Druig, with a great performance by Barry Keoghan. I really like most of the other characters and wish I could have seen more from them. Kumail Nanjiani is awesome, except when they give him random ""insert joke here"" lines. I'm curious to see more from most of the characters.
 This movie is still very flawed. And I absolutely hated how certain character conflicts were resolved after major decisions were made. But if you can move past the bad, you can enjoy the action, visuals, and ambition. Rating updated from 4 stars to 5 stars. (2 viewings, opening night 11/4/2021, 11/17/2021)"
ETERNALS,"Horrible Trying to be ""deep"", the director uses some long shots (or longer than usual in the MCU) here and there, less frenetic editing here and there, and less Marvel humor (there is enough though), in a thing that turned to be a really, really bad experiment. Valient effort though?
 In the end, none of that matters that much because the biggest problems with the movie are the simple things: way too many characters, all flat and not particularly interesting (maybe because there is not time to develop them); the interpretations from the important ones, the leads, robotic and soulless; the story told in unnecessary back and forth, maybe as an attempt to make it seem more complex than it was, and not letting the movie to get into any rhythm; and finally, contrary to what I read a lot, the special effects and the desings of the powers and suits and the actions scenes, all just bad, simple or with awful CGI (or a combination of those).
 Other than that, it was great(?)"
ETERNALS,"Eternals boring just like the Inhumans A couple of years ago, there was The Inhumans mini-series, featuring superheroes who lived on the Moon, but were supposedly protecting Earth. Now the Eternals are doing the same thing, with a similar cast of superheroes.
 Too many sets of protectors, too many lame superheroes with similar powers, too much boring back-story, just too much."
ETERNALS,"Magnificent to look but it's pretty much lifeless with boring actors playing boring characters Chlo√© Zhao's direction gives Marvel Cinematic Universe a much needed breath of fresh air, but 'Eternals' doesn't quite come together. Despite the fact the film claims to have a far more thought-provoking theme and a plethora of philosophical concepts, it fails to elaborate on them sufficiently to create a more compelling experience. The movie is still magnificent to look but it's pretty much lifeless with boring actors playing boring characters."
ETERNALS,"Definitely the MCU's weakest movie Eternals had the potential to be a real standout film from the crowd, but it missed out on breaking ranks from its franchise's long-held cliches like 'action scene then funny one-liner' moments that don't feel like character moments anymore, but 'creative mandates' imposed by the studio.
 It's a BIG movie, so big that it's got too many stories for it's single-movie outline and all these brand-spanking-new characters who desperately needed more character development outside Eternal's 2 and ¬Ω hour runtime. This movie is a 'beautifully made mess': and it's bound to be 'retconned' with a throwaway line of dialogue (or with some jokes) in one of the next Avengers movies like Thor 2 was in Ragnarok.
 Eternals gets 2/5 stars. It tries to stand out, but it's ultimately more of the same."
ETERNALS,"one boring trip, I stopped after one hour And then magic happened, Eternals on Disney streaming. Another entry in the Marvel world. And have seen enough trailers I was ready for it, it looked great but...
 ...after one hour I turned this off. On part of the effects it all looked great but what the hell about the story and characters. It's all one boring mess. Nothing happens and when things happens I was thinking, okay, is this it? Fighting against CGI creatures. Not that I have a thing against CGI creatures but it was all lame.
 The beginning was okay with the history of the world but then it just became one boring love story and as one said, a lifeless flick.
 How much I tried, It won't stick for eternal in my mind.
 Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5."
ETERNALS,"Most boring supers ever I can understand Marvel wanting to expand its universe; all you have to do is look at the dollars to understand it. But, the thing about superheroes, they have to be super beyond their powers. I didn't know anything about these characters and frankly after watching this movie I don't want to know anymore. I thought Justice league and Batman versus Superman were bad. But nothing has been as boring as this movie. It's cheesy and preachy with no interesting characters except Sprite and the Deviant. I think they may need to stop cause superhero overload can cause bad movie making decisions."
ETERNALS,"Watching people who mostly can't die (eternals) fight each other can be boring This review has been declined 3 times now. I don't know why, I think it's cos of the real name of Gilgamesh coinciding with an english word.
 The whole film was pretty flat, John Snow turned up and said some funny lines, and Gemma Chan was lovely to look at, but there sure was a lot of cheese in this vegan meal of a film. Some terrible 'inspirational' life messages delivered direct to camera that made you cringe with their rhetoric.
 It played like it was constructed from a ""making big budget films for dummies"" book, and they left it at pretty much the bullet points list on the inside cover.
 Shoehorn in a Diversity cast that differed greatly from the source material. I do like to see diversity on screen but sometimes it appears over zealous, like this film and comes across as forced and token and works against the world of the film. The Eternals are not from earth at all so no need to tick all the diversity check boxes. Quite the opposite, they should appear with no cultural links at all. They also shoe horned in a sign language eternal, which just made no sense in the world of the Eternals, Why would the massively powerful universe creators create an eternal who couldn't hear or speak and needed to use their hands to communicate? The original comics had Makkari as a Male who has a relationship with Sersi, in fact many of the original Eternals are male. I'm all for positive representations on a diverse society, but this casting choice just came across as weird as far as the film's story was concerned.
 Slot in an ex boy band debut as an actor - Check!
 My eyes rolled back into my head when that happened. Big budget movie making by the numbers.
 I don't know quite where the problem was. Chlo√© Zhao's direction by committee choices? It wasn't all bad, there was some decent acting, particularly Barry Keoghan who's character seemed complex, but,... even so it was roped in and never went anywhere. Gilgamesh also was good, until he was dispatched easily.
 Then they started fighting each other, and they're Eternals and can't die, except when it's convenient to move the plot along. It got boring really quickly."
ETERNALS,"Long drawn out superhero film that spans time and ages! Not the greatest ""Marvel"" movie fan yet I gave ""Eternals"" a try even though never really hearing about it or reading the comics, and was not real impressed as the movie went back and fourth thru the ages and time as the group of Eternals were always fighting evil and the movie was a showcase of love and family like feel. It was an eye candy watch for seeing the hot and sexy Gemma Chan and Salma Hayek as immortals Sersi and Ajak as both were healers and watchers of the group. Overall my interest came and went the film for one was to long and drawn out as the message could have been shorter. Still I guess a watch if your a Marvel movie fan, and the look of Gemma Chan and Salma Hayek as superheroes was sexy and impressive."
ETERNALS,Hope This Timeline Isn't Eternal
ETERNALS,It just feels like an unnecessary movie
ETERNALS,"Worst MCU film ever Following the events of Avengers: Endgame (2019), an unexpected tragedy forces the Eternals, ancient aliens who have been living on Earth in secret for thousands of years, out of the shadows to reunite against mankind's most ancient enemy, the Deviants.
 This film is by far the worst MCU film I have watch. It's massive insuylt to the comics from the Jack Kirby days. Gender swapping some of the eternals, bad story telling which makes absolutely no sense, unlikeable characters, little to no action and ridicules changes to the MCU just sum up how bad this film. Completely ruined Endgame
 The only goods were the music and the CGI for Arishen as well as bonus points for being voiced by David Kaye.
 Other then that it's just not a good movie makes both Captain Marvel and Iron Man 3 look good."
ETERNALS,"I don't understand the hate Not really sure why this movie got so much hate. It's introducing a swath of new superhero's and doesn't really converge with any other Avengers plot lines save for a few mentions of Thanos, Thor and some other hero's. That job on its own isn't an easy one and I think they did a fantastic job of giving us a new storyline. The shear scale of the movie was well done both in terms of time periods and in general how epic and massive everything felt. Loved the diversity of the characters - every one of them added something to the story. With that being said - and this is coming from just your average Marvel fan with no knowledge of the comics - the Eternals powers all seemed a bit underwhelming. Maybe it's just that they were trying to display how powerful the deviants were but even Ikaris couldn't take down one on his own. Other than that the movie was absolutely beautifully shot - maybe the best looking Marvel movie to date. Again, I'm not sure what the hate is about but I thoroughly enjoyed watching it."
ETERNALS,"Underrated I personally feel like this movie is very underrated. It's not as jokey or flashy as any of the other Marvel movies but that's kind of why I like it. It felt less like a superhero movie and more like an art film about gods and what it does to your psyche when you live for such a long time on the planet that's not yours.
 There's a lot of different diverse personalities in this and it shows interesting ways of how these characters and not only cope with their longevity but also take advantage of the world around them. Even though the characters seem wooden in the beginning of the movie as time goes on you start to at least in my opinion connect with them and their relationships to each other. I love the fact that the humor isn't over the top and one is there it's to help you understand the characters more instead of just being goofy for the sake of being goofy.
 The main point of the movie is basically about the passing of time and what it does to people. Hence the song played over the marvel logo being Time by Pink Floyd. As time goes on these characters change how not only how they feel about each other but humanity all together, for better or for worse.
 There are also twists in the movie that I did not expect that were pretty surprising. Without going into much detail I like the fact that all of these characters are kind of in the gray and aren't 100% good guys or bad guys. It feels more like a Snyder film in the sense that it's less about superheroes being quippy and trying to save the day and more about imperfect gods trying to figure out what there purpose is.
 To a lot of people this felt like a huge step backwards for the MCU. For me this was a refreshing change of pace for these movies.
 The only negatives that I will say is that I did not care at all about the romance between Ikaris and Sersi. There was absolutely zero chemistry between them. Also, personally, I can't stand Sprite. She is an insufferably selfish character she just came off as super annoying."
ETERNALS,Easily one of the worst movies I've seen this year tbh
ETERNALS,"Spectacular visuals, but"
ETERNALS,Won't watch again
ETERNALS,"A Breath of Fresh Air in the Marvel Cinematic Universe I went in with little to no expectations and I was pleasantly surprised by what the movie offered. Multiple relatively unknown new characters and their dynamics, their stories spanning centuries.
 It was definitely not a typical Marvel fare that at least I'm acclimated with. Watching this movie, it didn't feel like it's an MCU movie. It was different, something unexpected.
 I do understand some people not liking this movie. I have some criticism too, like the editing in the beginning seemed a bit sloppy. And watching it in IMAX, the transition between aspect ratios was not smooth, very apparent and a bit distracting. The visuals on the other hand were amazing. Some of the action sequences were really good and were executed perfectly (like the usage of hand held camera during a fight scene between a deviant and Ikaris in Amazon).
 Overall, it felt nice to witness something very different from MCU. I am eager to see them try new things and take their world to different directions and keep it interesting and unpredictable."
THE BLUE LAGOON,"Always enjoyable, sweet and moving film I have always liked this film, and don't like it when it is criticized so much. Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins did a wonderful job, they were excellent. Brooke is a beautiful, talented actress. The scenery was just gorgeous, it makes you want to fly off to Fiji where they filmed most of the movie to see what it is really like. The music is also very good. The story starts out with a ship which catches fire, and everyone is forced to abandon ship. Two young children, Richard and Emmeline, as well as a drunken cook named Paddy, get on a lifeboat together and drift on the sea for many days, until they discover land, a bunch of little remote tropical islands. They build a home there. Time passes, and Paddy passes away, but Richard and Emmeline continue growing up together. They get older, and new feelings come over them. They discover many things about adolescence and sex. This is a great love story, sweet and lovable. Brooke and Chris make a great onscreen couple. The sex/nudity scenes are not really that bad at all, they're rather mild. There is more nudity in the underwater swimming sequences, but mostly all of that was done by Brooke's stand-in, a professional diver. I really like this movie, and even though there are a few logic loopholes, it is still enjoyable. My only complaint: I think this film could've gone on for about 5 more mins. or so and explained things a little bit better."
THE BLUE LAGOON,"Oddly Captivating The Blue Lagoon is one of those strangely captivating movies. A unique storyline, and well cast characters. For two young actors they manage to portray compelling chemistry and honesty. Though of course the two people growing up on a semi deserted island would just happen to be absolutely gorgeous."
THE BLUE LAGOON,"Robinson Crusoe for adolescents THE BLUE LAGOON enjoys something of a cult reputation these days after proving an enormous success on first release and recuperating its own budget many times over. It's a simple enough story about a young boy and girl who are stranded on a tropical island, but instead of the usual survival elements of the story the focus is on their developing sexual relationship.
 I admit it's not particularly the type of film I find interesting but the stunning Fijian locations were enough to keep me watching. Unfortunately the acting from the clearly inexperienced leads is less than impressive and wooden in places and seasoned performers such as the ever delightful Leo McKern have all too little screen time. Sure, Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins may be superficially beautiful but they're able to reveal little below the surface.
 Instead of getting more gripping as the story progresses, I found that this film actually got less interesting as it focuses more deeply on the relationship between the characters. The so-called sexual tension is handled in a rather twee and dated fashion and the ending feels tacked-on instead of a natural development of the plot - you think they're either incredibly lucky or wonder why they didn't try it long before.
 After directing the hugely successful GREASE Randal Kleiser saw his star gradually waning with the final inevitability of making TV movies and straight-to-DVD releases. THE BLUE LAGOON reveals him to be a workmanlike character rather than a real auteur with a love of his material so it's no surprise that he faded into obscurity after one brief blast of fame."
THE BLUE LAGOON,A boy and a girl grow up on a deserted island
THE BLUE LAGOON,"A Garden of Eden just built for two with nothing to mar their joy This third version of The Blue Lagoon is beautifully shot in the South Seas where the story actually takes place and that adds a lot to the telling of the story. A couple of young beauties of the time Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins complete the picture.
 Brooke Shields was well into her career when Blue Lagoon came out, but for Christopher Atkins this was his debut film. In a novel Hollywood success story picked from a group of unknowns to star in this film. I well remember Atkins as the great Hollywood 'it' boy of the early 80s. He had a great following with both women and gay men at the time.
 Both Brooke and Chris carry the innocence look off very well. The story is that while bound for San Francisco on a schooner the ship catches fire and the children are herded into a lifeboat by gruff sailor Leo McKern. They make it to the island and soon enough McKern is killed off.
 The kids are left to their own devices and grow up to be Brooke and Chris. And like in the Irving Berlin song soon are doing what comes naturally. Well maybe not that soon.
 The film holds up well for 40 years at this point. Stays just this side of soft core porn as well. Not exactly G or PG rated though."
THE BLUE LAGOON,"It's not bad for two people stuck on an island Oh, come on. I know more than a few people who enjoyed ""The Blue Lagoon"". This is actually a wonderful story and yes, there a more than a few questions. I mean, how do two children survive on a deserted island? I'm not sure, but the story worked well.
 This is a true love story, because it comes from natural love. This isn't like ""You're the only girl/boy on this island, so..."". This was more of ""I'm falling in love with this woman/man."" Their love for each other was so unique and wonderful that it makes you want to be on a deserted island with someone. Plus having Christopher Atkins or Brooke Sheilds as your partner helps somewhat too. :D It's a great movie that I feel is a bit under rated. Give it a chance.
 7/10"
THE BLUE LAGOON,"The only film to have made a greater contribution to herpetology than than to culture Ever since at least the eighteenth century, the ""desert island"", the uninhabited tropical island with golden beaches fringed with palm trees, has frequently been depicted in Western culture as the nearest one can get to paradise on earth, in literature, the cinema and even in advertising campaigns. (The makers of the ""Bounty"" chocolate bar have for decades centred their entire marketing strategy around this concept). In the twentieth century writers, such as William Golding in ""Lord of the Flies"", Alex Garland in ""The Beach"" and J G Ballard in ""Rushing to Paradise"", started to subvert this idea, but ""The Blue Lagoon"", based on a novel from 1908, is a film which takes it largely at face value.
 The film is set in the late Victorian period. Two young children, Richard and Emmeline, survive a shipwreck in the South Pacific and are stranded on a lush tropical island along with a seaman named Paddy Button. Paddy dies not long afterwards, but not before he has taught the children the skills they need to survive on the island. Richard and Emmeline grow up and turn into beautiful teenagers, fall in love, and have a child of their own. At which point¬Ö¬Ö Well, you'll have to watch the film to find out what happens at this point.
 An earlier version of the story was filmed in 1949. It is a long time since I last saw that film, but I recall that (as one might expect of a film from the forties) it contains far less nudity and sexual activity than does the 1980 version. The 1980 film was, in fact, quite controversial, largely because the actress playing Emmeline, Brooke Shields, was only 14 years old at the time of filming. (Two years earlier, Shields had starred in the even more controversial ""Pretty Baby"" about a child prostitute). It was later revealed that body doubles were used in the sex scenes, but even so many people were shocked by the film's sexual frankness and especially by nude scenes which appeared to feature a girl so young. (One thing which aroused surprisingly little comment is the fact that Richard and Emmeline are first cousins, even though cousin marriage is illegal in many American states).
 The film was a success at the box office, probably because of its sexual explicitness and the good looks of its two young stars, but today it has a very dated feel. Much of the problem lies in the fact that its stars appear to have been cast on the basis of their looks alone, without regard to acting activity. Shields, in fact, had the dubious honour of winning the first ever ""Worst Actress"" Razzie. It may have been cruel to give such an award to a teenage girl (Farrah Fawcett-Majors probably deserved it more for ""Saturn Three""), but it has to be admitted that Shields is not very good here. She had given a good performance in ""Pretty Baby"", but the transition from child star to teenage star can be a difficult one, and here she seems horribly embarrassed and self- conscious and, moreover, does not always speak her lines clearly. It might have been better if an older actress aged about 18 or 19 had been cast in the role. Richard and Emmeline are supposed to be around the same age, but Shields is in fact four years younger than her co-star Christopher Atkins, and it shows. Casting an actress in her late teens would also have removed any controversy about underage nudity.
 As for Atkins, this was his first film. He has, apparently, gone on to enjoy a long acting career, although I do not recall seeing any of his later films; the only subsequent part I remember him in was as Sue- Ellen's toyboy in ""Dallas"". His career has been much longer, I suspect, than many would have predicted for him on the basis of ""The Blue Lagoon"", where he is very stiff and wooden, with little chemistry between him and Shields. The best acting performance comes from the veteran Leo McKern as Paddy, playing him as a mixture of kindly father- figure and drunken old reprobate; the film loses a lot of interest after his death relatively early on.
 There are a few holes in the plot. It appears that the island is inhabited by, or at least regularly visited by, a tribe of people (portrayed here, in the best politically incorrect fashion, as bloodthirsty cannibals), but it is never explained how these inhabitants manage to go at least ten years without discovering two strangers living on their island. It might have been more plausible if Paddy had remained alive for longer; the small children we see in the early scenes seem too young to be capable of surviving on their own. And how does Richard manage to stay so clean-shaven throughout? (Presumably the film-makers felt that a bearded Atkins would have seemed much less cute to the teenage girls who made up a large part of the film's intended audience).
 Visually, the film is an attractive one, with some striking photography of the island and its wildlife. The cinematographer N√©stor Almendros was nominated for a ""Best Cinematography"" Oscar, the only nomination the film achieved. Overall, however, ""The Blue Lagoon"" is really no more than yet another sentimental teenage romance movie with an exotic setting and two miscast stars. Its only distinction lies in being possibly the only feature film to have made a greater contribution to science than to the arts. Some scenes were shot on a small island in Fiji, and a herpetologist watching the film realised that the iguanas featured were a species hitherto unknown to science. Today it is classified as the Fiji Crested Iguana (Brachylophus vitiensis); they should have called it Brachylophus bluelagoonii. 4/10"
THE BLUE LAGOON,""" From the Sea world springs life and love eternal "" There are many stories about the sea and shipwrecks. Here is one of the more controversial, due in part because of censors, not the beautiful drama. It is the story of two children who experience a violent storm and ship disaster which culminates in their being stranded, shipwrecked and given up for dead. However their luck is not all bad, they happen to be fortunate enough to have an experienced seaman named Paddy Button (Leo McKern) who deems it necessary to teach the two kids, Richard (Christopher Atkins) and Emmeline (Brooke Shields) how to survive on a deserted island. When their teacher is no longer able to continue their education, the two children grow up alone. The story is honest and allows much lea-way into what might happen as they learn to exist without adult guidance. Safe to say, director Randal Kleiser creates a wonderful and idea world for them allowing them to self-discover who and what they are. Writer Henry Stacpoole's dialog is simple and uncomplicated and together they created a stirring memory in the hearts and minds of anyone who longs to be stranded on an equally Blue island location. ****"
THE BLUE LAGOON,"Too simple The movie is very slow with almost no plot. A love story? A boy and girl are left on a an island alone to grow up together. As hormones fall into place when they reach that special age, they follow their teenage wants and needs . The movie is very simple, drawn out and full of unnecessary nudity. It has it's beauty to it and the idea of living on an island is always a fun one to explore, but I feel this movie could have been much better."
THE BLUE LAGOON,"Classic teenage film The Blue Lagoon (1980) starring Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins is a classic teenage movie. The acting by both of the lead actors certainly isn't Oscar winning by any means, in fact at some moments it's really bad. They were young actors at the time and weren't all that experienced, so I'll take it easy on them. At least they were attractive, as many audience members commented. I know all the ladies and gay guys really enjoyed seeing Christopher Atkins shirtless and seeing his bare backside. And I'm sure the straight guys enjoyed Brooke Shields. A lot of teens in 1980 said that it was the sexiest thing they had ever seen, which is hard for our generation to understand I'm sure. But yes, it's true, the blue lagoon is sexy. So if you want a movie with eye candy actors, mild sexual scenes that aren't graphic in nature, this might be for you. The film's plot is pretty good, but the script lacks intelligence. The movie just really suffers when it comes to the dialogue and the acting by the leads. Yes, the scenery is beautiful and yes, it's sexy. Although, other than its sexiness and pretty scenery, it's just not all that much to see. I'm giving The Blue Lagoon 6/10 stars for its sexiness, pretty scenery, and it's interesting plot."
THE BLUE LAGOON,"""It ain't proper to be running 'round naked all the time!"" Two kids (cousins!) become stranded on an island with a fat old drunk who yells a lot. Eventually the drunk dies and they're left to fend for themselves. As the kids become teenagers, they turn into Christopher Atkins and Brooke Shields. It's at this point that the movie becomes what it's famous for being: two attractive teens discovering sex in the wild. Most people are either going to think this is a story of innocent love unhindered by societal conventions or they'll see it as a cheap piece of exploitation. I'm trying my best to view it as the former but the cynic in me finds it hard to deny that the latter is probably the only reason this was green-lit in the first place. For the record, if you haven't seen it, the nudity does not only come from Atkins and Shields (or her adult body double in some scenes) but from the pre-teen children playing the younger versions of their characters as well.
 Judging the movie on its technical merits, it's pretty hard to deny that the gorgeous island scenery and the nice score are big pluses. But the story is paper thin and the acting is atrocious. There is potential for a good movie here, if it were treated as a realistic story of two kids struggling to survive while also dealing with growing into puberty with no adults around to guide them. But director Randal Kleiser is more focused on flesh peddling and the single most insipid romance to ever hit the screen. As it is, we're left with a curiosity that isn't a good film at all but will hold a salacious appeal for some viewers."
THE BLUE LAGOON,NOT A CHILDREN'S MOVIE - FOR YOUNG ADULTS AND OLDER
THE BLUE LAGOON,"Just imagine how they would handle it today? Often while watching this movie I asked myself, How would filmmakers tackle this or that scene today, 25 years later? And while I am certainly not going to applaud 'The Blue Lagoon' as an overlooked masterpiece, CERTAINLY not!, it is still a far cry better than the standard teenage soft-porn that is on offer today.
 Basically, 'The Blue Lagoon' is about two horny teenagers finding their own path towards sexual fulfillment and adulthood, and it strives to point the way for its multitudes of teenage audiences with some dignity and even fearlessness. Today footage of completely naked infants as well as pre-teens and teens would simply never be realized or even permitted in mainstream OR art cinema, God forbid! Brooke Shields' frank alluding to Christopher Atkins' masturbatory habits could, in a movie today, only be filmed amidst a sea of giggles, whereas in 1980 they did it very deadpan and honestly.
 The film is full of quite touching scenes and gently, if not exactly marvelously acted. I liked Atkins' prayer that the sick Shields be saved, and he doesn't remember how a prayer goes: ""Our Father who art in Heaven ... Kingdom come ... Liberty and justice for all. Amen"". They don't lead terribly eventful lives on that desert island, but their everyday rituals are beautifully filmed, and the underwater sequences are memorable."
THE BLUE LAGOON,"For Teen Girls Only If you are anything other than a 11-16-year-old girl, you are advised to skip this film. Chances are, it won't do much for you. This is strictly a teen girls movie, pure and simple.
 Brooke Shields {""Emmeline"") and Christopher Atkins (""Richard"") swim half naked in the beautiful waters of some South Pacific Island and both are young, ""beautiful people."" The girls will swoon at Atkins and admire Shields, wishing they were her.
 It's kind of an early two-person ""Survivor"" show before there was a hit TV series as the kids, er, young adults, learn to cook and do other things after being shipwrecked on this island and then having the ship's cook die. In the meantime, they learn about sex and other exciting topics.
 If you're a guy and you think you might be titillated by watching a pretty teen girl naked, forget it. Brooke's chest, which isn't much to start with, is covered up with her long hair and she's replaced by doubles on other scenes, so go elsewhere for your soft porn. It's not that kind of movie.
 Overall, I found it fairly boring, empty story with only the beautiful island scenery appealing. The two stars are lackluster. The fact that neither one, particularly Atkins, ever became a star in the business tells you something about their acting ability. Once the young looks were gone, so was their brief and over-inflated ""career"" from this movie. If you think I'm being a little too rough on them, check out their film resumes - there isn't much there in the way of impressive films or anything you've even heard about."
THE BLUE LAGOON,Beautiful
THE BLUE LAGOON,"hormone cinema It's late 19th century. Young Richard Lestrange, his widowed father and orphaned cousin Emmeline Lestrange are on a clipper to San Francisco. Fire engulfs the ship and the cook Paddy Button (Leo McKern) takes the kids into a lifeboat. They get separated from the other lifeboat by the fog and land on a tropic island in the Pacific. They find skulls, signs of natives, and a cast of rum. Paddy drowns after a drunken binge. Richard (Christopher Atkins) and Emmeline (Brooke Shields) move to an isolated beach building a new home.
 This is hormone cinema wrapped in a Swiss Family Robinson adventure. The hormone cinema is cringe-worthy. This is not a subtle movie. It is deliberately pushing out the young flesh for public consumption. However as a young boy, this was a guilty pleasure. I can't complain about the sincerity of the young actors. This is generally a bad movie but everybody can like a few of those."
THE BLUE LAGOON,Nature will always have it's way.
THE BLUE LAGOON,"nothing comes from nothing it's too bad this uses a lot of beautiful photography of a very beautiful island. If only it used shoddy backdrops for scenery, then it would stand as the masterwork of the ""so bad it's funny!"" genre (if we can call it that).
 Unfortunately, with all this lush scenery, our eyes, pained with having to look at these teen-age twerps trying to act, drift repeatedly to the background, where the breeze gently teasing the palm leaves reminds us that time is passing, and we feel morbidly paralyzed by boredom, horrifyingly reminded that, for the lurid expectation of a voyeuristic glimpse of teen-age lust (however briefly - very briefly), we are letting our lives just waste away as we try to find some image or line of dialog of any meaning or importance - but this never arrives. So we flow grudgingly along a slow current of sludge into the lagoon where we are so buried under poor writing and atrocious acting, we are forced to confront the eternal question of human life: ""Is this it?! Is this all there is?!"" and hope - longingly, lovingly - for a painless death....
 Or we switch the channel to the Cartoon Network and find some reason for being alive. ""SPAAACE GHOOOST!"""
THE BLUE LAGOON,"Disney meets 9 and a half weeks OK - I've not actually seen 9 1/2 weeks. But I wanted a suitable summary title.
 When I first saw this romantic fantasy, aged 16 and I was 'undecided' and, frankly fancied both the grown-up girl and boy castaways as they naturally, but reluctantly fell into love. Natural, unforced nudity is clean and pure and to witness these two heavenly creatures being human mermaids was - and frankly is, still a joy. I strongly felt at the time that Brooke Shields was the most perfect creature on God's Earth, because of her part in this film.
 The storyline to this oft derided tale of Castaway romance is straight out of a Disney feature. All it needs is a shaggy dog (or is that the story itself?) to complete it.
 You know, shipwrecked as a couple of young kids, an Ooh-arghh of a pirate like uncle to raise them and somehow they grow up in perfect health and when the old man snuffs it they still have perfect health and an idyllic life together. An ever-present mysterious enemy never really causes more than the odd bad dream. And no one ever gets sunburned.
 Viewing again after a decade, I find the trite dialogue painful, the ridiculousness of the scenarios gaping and obvious. In mid-winter Britain, now, however, this tropical paradise fable is a perfect antidote to real life.
 Nostalgically, The Blue Lagoon will always have a special, but seldom spoken of place in my heart. Those of who ""do"", will and those who ""don't"" will never. And I totally understand why. Whichever camp someone is in."
THE BLUE LAGOON,"One of the worst films ever made This movie is a waste of time - I shouldn't even waste my time reviewing it. But I will, to warn others not to waste their time. This is a shameless picture, marketed to young teens, in spite of the ""R"" rating. Who else would find Shields and Atkins parading around half-naked appealing? The script stinks, with way too much time spent on them discovering their bodily maturations. And the acting... UGH! Yes, I know they are developmentally and intellectually stunted by growing up on an island by themselves - so, no I wasn't expecting earth shattering dialogue. But what dialog was there, I expected to be delivered with some semblance of true feeling and genuine emotion. Instead, you have 2 stiffs acting ridiculous.
 And who let's their 14 year old daughter act in a movie with the themes and nudity in here. Utterly disgusting. I know they used a body double for Shields nude scenes, but this still borders on child pornography to me."
THE BLUE LAGOON,"One of my teenage guilty pleasures Beautiful young people starring in a beautifully shot, silly movie. This won't win any award, but I know it holds a special place in the teenage hearts of lots women of a certain age."
THE BLUE LAGOON,"""Only God knows everything."" .. ""He can't find us any better than Santa Claus."" Despite gleaming Oscar-nominated cinematography by no less an auteur than Nestor Almendros and an epic-sized music score from Basil Poledouris that seems ready to sound a romantic Second Coming, this screen-adaptation of Henry De Vere Stacpoole's novel (following a 1949 version starring Jean Simmons) became a preposterous success. To whom is it intended to appeal: budding teenage romanticists or prurient grown-up voyeurs? Two Victorian-age youngsters, prepubescent cousins on a high seas voyage, abandon ship after a fire and seek refuge on a tropical island with their elderly guardian, who soon dies. Marooned and alone (save for some drum beats in the distance), the two quickly mature and become curious about their own bodies and each other's. Muscles! Menstruation! Director Randal Kleiser makes an attempt early on to keep the mood light; however, this version seems even more na√Øve than the original (ridiculous as well, with two plot threads--a hostile tribe on the other side of the island and a threat of poisonous red berries--left dangling). Brooke Shields (or, rather, her body double) and Christopher Atkins show us lots of skin, but barely a trace of acting talent. Infuriating movie has water on the brain. Followed by a sequel/remake in 1991, in which we're told the characters from this film didn't simply ""fall asleep"" after eating those ominous berries, but perished in their boat on the water. At least the turtles made out all right. ** from ****"
THE BLUE LAGOON,"Critically underrated film that resonates with global audience I've never understood the critical slam this film has received. Then I saw the widescreen dvd version and understood; everyone has been watching it in pan and scan! The film is a visual poem. So much of the story telling is done through visual information. The impact of this is lost when the cinematography is altered. Remember that Nestor Almendros received an Academy Award nomination for his work on this film. The film has resonated with global audiences for so long for this very reason. I suggest people watch the dvd commentary with Randal Kleiser and Brooke Shields to get a better understanding of why this film is still such a popular one.
 People attack the acting, but these are children left alone with no one to guide them into adult sophistication. Their interaction and reactions to situations are very consistent with this scenario. Yes, the birth scene is a little rushed, but do we really need to see the umbilical cord? Not all films need to be about gritty reality, ala ""Taxi Driver."" No one asks to see the bloody guts of the smashed witch in ""The Wizard of Oz.""
 It is a beautiful, romantic film that speaks to millions of people. It seems that only the most skeptical cynics cannot embrace this film."
THE BLUE LAGOON,"Kiddie porn A young girl and young man are shipwrecked on a remote island when their ship burns down. An old man Paddy (Leo McKern) takes care of them teaching them how to survive in the wilds. He dies soon after and they are left by themselves. Years later they grow into Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins. They ""discover"" each other, have sex, a kid etc etc etc.
 Silly movie. When it came out in 1980 it was trashed by critics worldwide. They called it ""kiddie porn"" (due to the frequent nude shots of Atkins and Shields' double) and lashed out at the stars and director Randal Kleiser. However, the public LOVED this and it was a huge box office smash. My guess is people just went in to see handsome, buff Atkins and Shields' double nude (there's a LOT of frontal nudity here), and maybe the cinematography. There's nothing else here!
 The story is virtually nonexistent and, to be nice, Shields and Atkins can't ACT! Atkins is actually worse than Shields--hard to believe but true. Also their constant whining and bickering got annoying. Also they look suspiciously healthy and in GREAT shape after being abandoned for so long. It gets really silly when they discover sex leading to some hilarious soft-core sequences. However, nothing is really shown. My favorite scene has got to be when Shields has the baby. She goes into a dark forest, screams a few times...and they carry out a clean, dry, healthy baby. SHEEESH!!!! They also make bringing up a baby look like loads of fun. This movie was risky at the time for dealing with sex between teenagers (Shields was 15, Atkins was 19) but it's so far from reality nobody took this too seriously.
 The cinematography (a deserved Oscar nominee) by Nestor Almendros is just gorgeous. THAT'S what kept me watching--some of the shots take your breath away. Also there's a pretty good (if monotomous ) score by Basil Poledouris. But director Kleiser's only concern seems to be to show as much nudity as he possibly can get in an R rated film. This got by with it because most of the nudity is very casual and the two of them DO have great bodies!
 So, if you're not offended by that and you want to see some truly beautiful scenery, tune in. Just ignore the ""acting"" and hilarious leaps of reality. In the right frame of mind, you could probably find this all a laugh a minute. I'd love to know what Atkins and Shields think of this now."
THE BLUE LAGOON,"Satan on a blood binge I do not believe, for a single moment, anybody who says they saw this movie for any reason other than to find out how and when Aitkins and Shields 'get it on'.
 And when originally released, it disappointed everybody that Shields wouldn't show her ta-ta's. Also, as it turned out, the culminating make-out was unforgivably dull and badly photographed.
 I finally let this film catch up with me on cable while I was coming to with a hang-over. I was convinced I had blacked-out, died, and gone to hell. Leo McKern's hideous over-acting was the first intelligible impression I could make out, and it certainly was my idea of Satan on a blood binge.
 In effect, the film saved my life - I vowed to remain sober and never to see another Brooke Shields film again.
 Anybody who says there's a story in this mess is probably lying; anyone who actually believes there's a story here clearly needs rehab.
 Is there anything remotely 'real' in any of this? Yes; if you pay money to see it, you'll never get it back."
THE LOST CITY,silly and formulaic by design
THE LOST CITY,"Pieces that work and pieces that don't The Lost City has pieces that work and pieces that don't. Placing pretenders into an actual adventure is good for laughs and heart, yet much of this script is generic. Unimaginative MacGuffins, flat villains, and predictable romances are individually forgivable, but together, they override the premise's charm. Furthermore, the dialogue, humor, and plot devices are subpar. The cast enhances the material (especially Pitt and Radcliffe), but some scenes are groaners. Tatum's charisma shines through and Pitt's cameo provides flavor, but that isn't enough to pull The Lost City out of mediocrity. It isn't painful, but The Lost City misses more than it hits.
 Meanwhile, The Lost City's filmmaking is average. Its minor positives are the cinematography (intermittently dramatizing comedy and action), the sound (selling the combat and jungle setting), the production design (primarily real but often computerized), and the effects (employing real explosions amongst the CGI). Conversely, the editing occasionally sags (lingering on unessential jokes) and the music is distractingly trendy (forcing fun, rather than serving the narrative). Lastly, The Lost City lacks cohesion. Its humor and emotions never tonally blend, and instead take turns (which disconnects viewers). Ultimately, The Lost City has mild appeal, but functions inconsistently.

 Overall Score: 5.1/10."
THE LOST CITY,"Good fun. I wasn't expecting to enjoy this, but on the whole, I did, some bits of it were pretty silly, but there were some nice moments, and a few bits that had me in stitches. Some of the sweeter, romance moments were maybe a little corny, but that's what was expected I guess.
 Nice special effects, it looks great, I loved the locations used. You can argue it had a somewhat old fashioned, maybe old school vibe about it, but sometimes you just need a bit of silliness in your life.
 Nicely acted, they all did a good job, Daniel Radcliffe was good fun, always enjoy his work.
 It really does make the most of Channing Tatum's looks, and it does work, he is ridiculously handsome, and there are several tongue in cheek moments, he seems like a good sport.
 7/10."
THE LOST CITY,"A Solid, Throwback Comedy Mainstream comedies that actually make it to theatres are slim to none these days. I remember a time when there was possibly a big comedy coming out every one or two months, with at least half of them being good, but in today's climate, humour is just tough to get right. I was very happy to see that Paramount would be taking a chance and releasing a big comedy in The Lost City this year, but I truly didn't know to what to expect from it. After seeing it in theatres, I'm happy to say that I had a good time with it. It's not great, but it felt like a throwback comedy, just with a modern twist.
 To put it simply, The Lost City follows Loretta (Sandra Bullock) as she's on a book tour with her cover model Alan (Channing Tatum) to promote the release of ""The Lost City of D,"" but they are swept up in a kidnapping and find themselves on a real adventure in the jungle. Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe) is the reason Loretta was kidnapped in the first place, as he sees many similarities in her book to that of a real lost city. Being the privileged twerp that he is makes for a fun villainous storyline, even if it's pretty lame at times. Radcliffe aside (whom I still enjoyed), this film puts all of its weight on Tatum and Bullock to deliver the goods.
 This premise is clever enough to work as a film, but it all comes down to who you cast and if they can make the material work. I never thought I needed to see this duo together, but I'm very happy they worked so well. On top of that, I have to admit that the best moments in the film feature Brad Pitt's character Jack Trainer. He isn't in the film much, but every second he was on screen had me laughing. Where I found the film to be slightly uneven though, was in the fact that I wasn't sure if it wanted to be funny or dramatic at times.
 I'm all for heartfelt storylines as well as comedy, but I would argue that the majority of the humour is in the first half, while the second half gets a little more sentimental. These both worked in the movie, but the way the film begins gives absolutely no foreshadowing as to what the film will become by the end. I found that odd, but again, the cast sold all of the dialogue for me. From a few hilarious moments to some fun adventure/action throughout, as I said, I had a good time with this one.
 In the end, The Lost City is exactly what I think moviegoers need right now. Nothing too serious or weighed down by heavy drama. This is a good old-fashioned, silly comedy/romance that I feel works for what it is. It's not going to be the type of comedy that a lot of people are going to watch over and over again, at least I don't think, but the heart of the film is in the right place and it never takes anything too seriously. Now playing in theatres, I'd give a recommendation to The Lost City."
THE LOST CITY,"Enjoyable and amusing The first half of this movie is really funny. I was laughing more than most in the theater. There are so many well-written jokes and situational humor with about an 80% hit rate, including a few hilarious moments. The characters are fleshed out enough for me to care. The story is formulaic and relatively weak compared to the other aspects, but that's easily forgiven when it's making me laugh.
 In the second half, the laughs slow down drastically. It gets a lot more serious with attempts at character arcs and story moments that aren't bad but are things we've seen a thousand times. I didn't hate watching it, but without as much comedy it's a much weaker movie.
 The first half is easily seven stars. The second half is a weak six. I wouldn't mind watching this again but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so. (1 viewing, opening Thursday night 3/24/2022)"
THE LOST CITY,"Better than the user rating on Imdb right now Bonkers that this film is rated only 6.1 on Imdb right now--it's better than that. Proof that folks who rate movies on here are sometimes guilty of the same crime that professional critics frequently make--looking the gift horse in the mouth. As you can see folks, this is not an art-house film--it's pure entertainment, and it delivers on that count.
 My wife and I saw this in the theater--the Brad Pitt cameo alone is worth the price of admission and both Channing Tatum and Sandra Bullock have lots of funny lines and pure situational/physical comedy too. What's not to like? A cast that's easy on the eyes and talented to boot, a fairly decent script and a love story with enough heft but still airy and entertaining."
THE LOST CITY,"A Mess of a Weak Plot and Little Chemistry From the early reviews I thought this was the film to see...but seeing it i'm amazed at those reviews.
 In short, this was a weak and humorless version of Romancing the Stone. Without any chemistry between the actors...except for the possible chemistry in Sandra Bullocks face.
 One minute they're in a city, then in the jungle, they're being shot at,then sleeping, the they're walking miles and miles...you don't know what the hell is going on."
THE LOST CITY,"Simple, fun, hilarious.... 7.0/10
 I actually enjoyed this film way more than I expected. It perfectly fits into its categories of action, adventure, comedy, and romance.
 The story was very enjoyable. It started off kind of wonky and felt like I was in for a bad time, but once the ""prologue"" passed and the main portion of the movie started it got much better.
 The chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum worked surprisingly well, and only got better as the film progressed. I did enjoy Daniel Radcliffe as the antagonist. More of a bratty rich boy than an evil ""I want to murder everyone"" kind of bad guy.
 By the end I felt that the big part of the film was that the romance was definitely geared towards the women while the action parts were geared towards the men. The comedy could've gone either way, and some may find certain parts funnier than others, both scenes and what's actually funny.
 I also enjoyed the score. The way certain soundtracks were worked into the scenes noticeably helped enhance them (as soundtracks should).
 Overall, I think this film is perfect for a movie date night. It's funny, it's romantic, it has a pretty good action/adventure story and it's not as cheesy as most romcoms tend to be.
 I hope my review helps you make a choice on this film. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!"
THE LOST CITY,"Cute and funny enough A cute and funny enough rom com, a few more of the jokes were stale than I would have liked, but overall it accomplished its goal. A few laughs, a few ""awhs"", and a whole lotta ""omg is Channing Tatum hot""'d."
THE LOST CITY,"Uggggggggghhhhhhh This was rough. I guess I put my expectations too high from the previews. The part with Brad Pitt was fine the rest a typical Sandra Bullock overreacting to mild inconveniences and complete stupidity. Shoutout to the marketing team for making this look like something I would enjoy when I knew better, but thought maybe? Just maybe? Well I knew better. This is terrible."
THE LOST CITY,"Mediocre at best... Great line up, but this film tries to hard to be funny with cringy and unforgettable action scenes... Felt like a total gimmick and clone of Romance in the Stone & Jewel in the Nile that both captured romance, action & humour so very well!
 I think Sandra Bullock should stick to drama movies! This movie was painfully boring."
THE LOST CITY,An enjoyable knockoff of Indiana Jones et al. Romantic and goofy.
THE LOST CITY,One of Bullock's and Tatum's worst movies
THE LOST CITY,"Moving on I try to avoid watching trailers before I see a movie. Sometimes it is inevitable - you can't escape certain trailers. So while I still managed not to see everything the trailer revealed, I already knew from the looks of it, that I would like the movie. And lo and behold the movie delivers the goods.
 There may be certain role reversals (or gender cliches that are being made fun of if you want to call it that), but the way the actors are playing their roles will not make you think too much about that. At least not in a negative light - some people seem to be allergic when it comes to ""wokeness"" I reckon.
 Channing Tatum has no problem taking his own image apart. Though he still will not accept bad dancing - but that is a different story. Harry Radcliffe ... I mean Daniel Potter ... ah well, the guy formerly known - actually still known as Harry Potter plays quite the fine villain.
 There is an excellent cameo in this and there is also a bonus scene during the credits that you cannot miss under any circumstances. Sit back, relax and if the humor is your cup of tea, you'll have a blast with this."
THE LOST CITY,"Truly a waste of time and talent I can't quite understand how these actors would choose to make such a unfunny comedy. The humor is so basic and simple that I can't believe the actors thought this would work. With movies like these it feels as though mainstream Hollywood is intentionally trying to dumb down the population or they have become so arrogant they think they can throw a few good actors together in a film that's made with 110% cheese! It's a cheese party and laughs and humor weren't invited! And the prized guests of the party were signs and facepalms whilst shaking ones head. Was this to make a quick buck? Maybe help out a fellow producer or writer who is a friend? Or maybe they just rely on the names to bring in the money, but I don't see how any of the stars in the film can actually watch this film and feel at all good about themselves and the product they've put out. It's just a complete and utter fail from the very beginning. All I was wondering throughout the film is ""why?"""
THE LOST CITY,Very fun despite some of the ridiculous bits Got to see the early ish screening considered date night on the regal app that was great time! One of the funniest things set up in the is experience was showing a short trailer of the movie 6 times that's never been a thing and there was feature before the movie started mostly talking about the red dress being a character itself that was silly. Didn't expect as much comedy as there was and highly entertaining action even an excellent soundtrack! I don't know about others but I loved the movie.
THE LOST CITY,"LOST HOURS OF MY LIFE This is a low budget, mediocre, lazy effort with some big names to try carry it from the precipice of lost DVD releases.
 Brad Pitt is great for the few minutes he's in it, but the rest is yawn worthy."
THE LOST CITY,"Jungle Dung Complete with Clich√©s & Stereotypes The amazing thing about this film -- despite the fact that it was made at all and that there isn't an original thought or idea throughout -- is that it's rated so highly on .imdb. It's also amazing that the talented actors ever agreed to be in this piece of jungle dung. The writing is terrible, amateurish, the dialogue silly, and the jokes totally unfunny. A total waste of talent.
 Makes one wonder how many of the positive reviews were left by paid Paramount employees."
THE LOST CITY,"Needs more Brad Pitt The chemistry between Bullock and Pitt is beyond words even though for only a minute or two. It's so powerful that it dulls the chemistry between Channing and Bullock. It's too bad that Brad wasn't given a much larger role as he has a real knack for comedy. It was likely to keep costs down or maybe he couldn't commit to more shooting days. If budget wasn't an issue I would have written a few more Pitt scenes in and maybe less goat. They tried to milk the goat bit (sorry) and it just wasn't funny. Radcliffe was good too and again he could have used a few more scenes. Still, money well spent just to watch Brad for a few minutes as he stole the entire movie."
THE LOST CITY,A poor mans Romancing the Stone
THE LOST CITY,"A fun and entertaining one time watch Novice writers and directors brother duo the Nee's did an impressive job with this full length feature film, especially considering their previous works were mainly shorts. The 112 runtime was used up well, although a little faster pacing and/or some scenes trimmed down would've shown better. Casting and performances were excellent, especially Channing Tatum who was the main source of laughs. The story is not revolutionary, but did have some refreshing changes to the genre. It's a fun and entertaining one time watch, especially if you're a fan of any of the lead cast."
THE LOST CITY,"Just stupid When you do not cut a simple plastic zipper with which you are tied to a chair, but instead carry the whole chair, you know the rescue opp is botched.
 This movie is plain stupid and irritating.
 The script is as if it's written by a five year old kid. Absolutely kiddish. The humour is forced and flat and the cast is pathetic.
 Worst, the end: there is no end. It just ends as foolishly as it began."
THE LOST CITY,"What a hapless abomination The makers of this movie are not a stupid as you would think having watched this garbage because they were smart enough to overplay Bratt Pitt's role which is 90% of the trailer and 1% of the film, the only good 1%. The writing is horrific, the acting wooden, the dialogue embarrassing and the plot stolen from Romancing The Stone. Sandra Bullock is awful, Channing Tatum, charmless and Daniel Radcliffe so bad it hurt my eyes to watch him. It is a truly awful film. It has no charm, no wit and no chemistry between the leads. I am angry at myself for wasting two hours on it."
THE LOST CITY,"Great duo and fun adventure but forgettable plot and thin amount of humor makes it decent. 3 out of 5 stars.
 Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum were great with there on screen chemistry and worked great with providing humor. Taking them on a adventure to searching for the lost city before the bad guys go after the search. The cast is good. The concept is fun. The film does have some humor and entertainment. The plot is forgettable. And the film does have a small amount of humor that cant carry the movie."
THE LOST CITY,"CGI on steroids. Low budget lockdown movie. Diabolical. I actually can not believe the good reviews for this. I had to leave 30 minutes before the end as couldn't stand anymore.
 It's CGI on steroids. In this day and age it amazes me that technology hasn't moved on so that you don't know it's a green screen. On many of the scenes it was so obviously green screen, it was embarrassing.
 There is virtually zero story. Clearly made in Lockdown on a low budget.
 Sandra Bolock appeared bored and what was it with the one outfit for the entire film? Channing Tatoe was his usual self just acting by numbers and showing off his body.
 I didn't even crack a smile let alone laugh and neither did anyone else in the theatre which was almost full.
 The writers should never be let loose on a script again.
 I despair of films lately, they just churn out any old rubbish and treat us like idiots.
 Shame on them all."
TICKET TO PARADISE,"A flat film. ""Ticket to Paradise"" is the clear example that the trailer is better than the movie itself. The script does not bring anything new to romantic comedies, it rushes to take the already known formula and fill the plot with the typical clich√©s. Julia Roberts and George Clooney offer simple performances without much charm, the secondary characters are more endearing as is the case with Wren Butler played by Billie Lourd. The filming locations are extraordinary and the cinematography makes them look even more beautiful. Returning to the script, it fails to catch on and as entertainment it doesn't go that far either. One of the worst moments is the terrible CGI with which a dolphin that appears on the screen for a few seconds was created. Movie to see once and not repeat."
TICKET TO PARADISE,"A lazy and weak remake. This is a loose remake of a French comedy with Dany Boon. That one was much funnier, with a better script. This one is lazy and treats viewers like morons, because it assumes that nice locations like Bali and two likeable, easy on the eye movie stars like Clooney and Roberts will guarantee success, no matter how bad and lazy the script is. It really looks like another comedy made quickly for Netflix. I don't recommend spending money on this, better wait for the streaming or TV... unless you are depressed, unhappy, down on your luck in your private life and quickly need some positive, optimistic and light entertainment. 3/10 for normal viewers, 8/10 if you're depressed and sad."
TICKET TO PARADISE,"A cookie cutter romcom Ticket to Paradise is a completely bog standard romcom. Not a single creative risk was taken in the making of this film. It is all very safe and predictable.
 They cast George Clooney and Julia Roberts and knew that that would be enough to get bums on seats, so they phoned in the rest.
 The comedy is all tried and tested stuff. The plot follows the traditional romcom formula, meaning you won't find any surprises here.
 This doesn't make it a bad film, its just got a pretty uninspired feel to it, as if it was made by a marketing team.
 The result is a charming, sweet, but unremarkable film. If you've ever seen a romcom then you've seen Ticket to Paradise, but it does have its moments."
TICKET TO PARADISE,"Enjoyed every minute! Oh don't listen to the negative reviews. This is a movie to just sit back and enjoy without overthinking. Can't people do just that anymore? You're spending almost 2 hours in a paradise with Julia Roberts and George Clooney, so the acting is guaranteed. The rest of the cast is awesome as well. So what if the story is predictable? Sometimes it's ok for our guess to be right when everything else is right. I laughed at the simple jokes and felt wonderful after watching this movie. This is the perfect movie if you want to take a break from trying to be the most intelligent person you know. I don't think the producers intended for it to be other than that."
TICKET TO PARADISE,"Clooney and Roberts are not enough to save this film George Clooney and Julia Roberts are two excellent actors and the Academy Awards they each won were well deserved. They are also two very suitable actors for romantic comedies, and if we accept the idea that good romantic comedies can be made with characters (and actors) in their 50s or even 60s, then casting them in the lead roles of a film of this kind may be a good idea. However, to make a quality romantic comedy something else is needed - a believable story that makes us resonate with the characters on the screen, possibly fall in love with them or suffer with them during the screening of the film. 'Ticket to Paradise' by director Ol Parker did not have the chance of such a scenario. By basing their film solely on the charm and magnetism of the two actors, the filmmakers have failed in their attempt to deliver quality entertainment. Clooney (at the peak of his charisma) and Roberts try their best, but it's not enough to save the film from the fate of a mediocre comedy.
 David (Clooney) and Georgia (Roberts) married 25 years ago and divorced 5 years later. Lily, their only daughter is finishing her law studies and a wonderful career awaits her starting in a prestigious law office. On the farewell college trip to Bali, the young woman meets a local seaweed farmer, falls in love with him, and decides to remain on the island paradise in the Indian Ocean. The two divorcees decide to join forces to convince their daughter to give up her marriage plans. The reasons are their own experience of a failed marriage but also the fear that the girl is destroying her life, at least according to Western or American patterns. The first 10-15 minutes offer the opportunity for funny exchanges of replicas, filmed with rhythm and using appropriately the technique of parallel frames. These are also the best comedic moments in the film, in my opinion. It is what follows that disappointed me.
 'Ticket to Paradise' reminded me of a tradition of American cinema in which the film fits very well. It's about dramas, sentimental comedies or musical films produced in the 30s whose stories took place in the world of the super-rich dressed in tuxedos, sumptuous dresses and fur coats. Spectators of those times, preoccupied with economic crises and - towards the end of the decade - with the danger of war, filled the theaters where charismatic heroes played by actors such as Clark Gable or James Stewart appeared on the big screens. With a few changes in scenery and dialogues, 'Ticket to Paradise' could have been made then. George Clooney is, by the way, the actor closest to the profile of the great American actors mentioned, and he is formidable in this film. But I think that his charm (and to a lesser extent that of Julia Roberts) are not enough to carry the whole movie. The relationship between the two is too predictable and the parallel love story between the two young people is completely missed. Kaitlyn Dever as the daughter is, I think, a terrible miscasting. At no point do we see her as an intelligent young woman making a sensible decision. The way in which the natural paradise of Bali is described is at the level of tourist clips commercials and the presentation of the local culture smella paternalistic Western folklorism. I understand that the intention of the filmmakers is here also an escapist cinema that disconnects its viewers from the problems of the day, but in the absence of authenticity and a somewhat believable story, the effect risks being missed. I'm afraid that only the joy of seeing George Clooney and Julia Roberts again and together is what will be left after watching this film."
TICKET TO PARADISE,"Formulaic romantic comedy done right Ticket to Paradise follows a very familiar formula that has very few surprises in its narrative but that works as a nice reminder as to why this formula works so well when done right, especially in the hands of two perfectly matched screen legends.
 George Clooney and Julia Roberts are both great, having worked together many times before their chemistry and comedic timing is instant and extremely strong. Kaitlyn Dever is really good with a warmth makes her sudden relationship feel genuine.
 Ol Parker's direction is also really good, the location constantly looks gorgeous and it maintains a solid pace throughout. The music by Lorne Balfe works perfectly for the film's tone, so grand and swoon worthy."
TICKET TO PARADISE,You've seen this 100's before
TICKET TO PARADISE,"Early 00's romantic comedy essence! If you are fed up with all these Netflix comedies lacking of humour having actually push yourself to crack a smile "" Ticket to Padise "" will definitely make things easier for you.
 It was a relief to watch a rom com that had fast paced just to the point dialogues. The staring couple was great. Their long last friendship had them feel comfortable with each other so they had a great connection in front of the cameras. Roberts is one of tbe best actresses ever in a variety of genres but romantic comedies will always have her as their Queen!
 So if you are looking for a ticket that gets you a couple of hours of joy and relaxation this movie is the answer. Enjoy!"
TICKET TO PARADISE,"It failed at being funny, but it kinda succeeded at being sentimental. Mixed bag. The bad: Why didnt they make a movie entirely about Julia Roberts and George Clooney? Now we have to see a bunch of other (below average) actors who only are present as ""fillers"" and who kinda irritated me by their bland acting performances.
 More bad: this movie wasnt funny. All the jokes fell flat. Honestly. This is suppose to be a romantic comedy, but I didnt laugh once. Not once. Bummer.
 The good: although it is lacking in good jokes, it has got TONS of sentimental, romantic scenes. It surely aint great drama (nowhere near), but it has got several tranquil, romantic scenes in which the right kinda sentimental loveydovey buttons get pushed, so all the fans of this romantic stuff will leave the cinema satisfied.
 All in all, I must say though that this is a missed opportunity to make a great romantic movie with these 2 stellar movie stars. They could have written a better script, with less stupid jokes and more true to life drama. Now it has become a Hallmark kind of movie, with lots of cheap sentiment that is a bit too much sugarcoated, (for me personally...)"
TICKET TO PARADISE,"Chump Change to Pay the Pool Cleaners Oof, this is just awful, predictable, by-the-numbers *romantic* comedy. The stars must've done this for the travel and maybe for cash to tip their servants. The trailer tells you everything, and gives you all the very mild laughs. Sure, Julia and George are charming, but they come off as shills here. The daughter is an idiot, and the fiance is flat. There's nothing good here for you. This is empty entertainment, and even in a time where people need fun, this is more like giving a greasy donut to a heart patient. Don't do this to yourself. Ask for better. You deserve it, and Roberts and Clooney owe it to us."
TICKET TO PARADISE,"A traditional story set in a stunning location and with star charisma. If you're going to produce a run of the mill romantic comedy/drama film then you may as well set it in one of the most beautiful places on earth and get some of the biggest names in Hollywood to lead it.
 - - - - - - - - -
 The location and scenery was stunning, the acting performances were good and although the story itself was by the numbers, it was enjoyable light hearted entertainment with a light moral message.
 - - - - - - - - -
 It does run for a bit too long and the outtakes were by far the funniest part of the film.

 Overall, I would score this film as a six out of ten."
TICKET TO PARADISE,Sometimes this movie felt like the opposite of paradise
TICKET TO PARADISE,"Predictable, tired, with unlikeable main characters"
TICKET TO PARADISE,"Ignore the haters. A lovely feel good film !!! Ticket to paradise is a 2022 romantic comedy film starring Julia Roberts and George Clooney. I have been waiting to see this movie and the trailer looked brilliant. The storyline was really good kept me entertained from beginning to end with plenty of laughs. George Clooney and Julia Roberts are just so perfect and can play any character and make it believable, fantastic acting as always. The chemistry between them both is so good and there play the characters really well. The film has stunning scenery Bali is a beautiful place I would love to go there after seeing this movie. Ticket to paradise is a feel-good film and you will find you will fall in love with this movie you will be laughing and you will come out of the cinema feeling happy. Ignore the haters it's a brilliant film get the popcorn out get to the cinema and get watching you won't be disappointed. Don't know why it has a low rating it's much better than a what there are saying . In all cinemas now."
TICKET TO PARADISE,"Really rather dull, but Queensland looks lovely"
TICKET TO PARADISE,"Stopped the misery after 15 minutes My husband was being sweet and offered to watch this movie with me. I like Julia Roberts and I like romantic movies. Notting Hill is still one of my favorite movies. So, I was happy to start.
 And also to stop our misery after 15 minutes. This movie was so bad. And then mostly the characters of Julia and George. I just could not watch this badly written movie. How on earth did they say yes to this movie? My parents are divorced and do not like each other. But this is so over the top, it is painful. Hence I saved myself and my husband from this misery. Please do not make yourself and your loved one watch this."
TICKET TO PARADISE,The definition of mediocre work
TICKET TO PARADISE,"A feel-good romantic comedy. Ticket to Paradise tells the story of Georgia(Julia Roberts) & David(George Clooney). Georgia & David are a divorced couple, who have a daughter named Lily(Kaitlyn Dever). When they find out that Lily is getting married, the former couple travel to Bali to stop their daughter's wedding. They do this to prevent her from making the same mistake they think they made, 25 years ago.
 Ticket to Paradise is an awe-inspiring film. Director Ol Parker has given us a laugh-out-loud, emotional & feel-good movie, reuniting two Hollywood icons. The comedic one-liners & set pieces are hysterical. The romance element is perfect, too. The cinematography by Ole Bratt Birkeland captures the gorgeous scenery, in all its glory. The music by Lorne Balfe is melodious. Julia Roberts is spectacular as Georgia. George Clooney is outstanding as David. Roberts & Clooney share effortless chemistry together & it's the highlight of the film. Kaitlyn Dever is fantastic as Lily. Maxime Bouttier is superb as Gede. Billie Lourd is amazing as Wren Butler. The supporting cast is awesome. Ticket to Paradise is a must watch for Julia Roberts & George Clooney fans & romantic comedy buffs. Go & have an extremely delightful time!"
TICKET TO PARADISE,"Enjoyable Entertainment George Clooney and Julia Robert together again in this new rom-com. An entertaining and delightful movie with the predictable humor and dramatic bits, playful. The A-stars are cast as divorced parents who plot to stop the wedding of their daughter, attorney to be to a seaweed cultivator. A good way to briefly and necessarily escape all the realistic geo-economic-political intrigue of current events and be transported to a beautiful island beach with amazing sunsets. We deserve it. Both Clooney and Julia seem comfortable in their roles, bickering and playing off each other. The cultural setting and marriage ceremony stands out as refreshingly different."
TICKET TO PARADISE,"Was iffy at first but this is one of the sweetest Romances I've seen Plenty of comedic moments, heartwarming, lots of banter, and a little corny yet all worth it! Ticket to Paradise is excellent I didn't expect to enjoy so much I was smiling even blushing towards the end I don't know if that's a spoiler but I'm very satisfied with the movie all around. I love how George Clooney and Julia Robert's starred in the Ocean's films not that it's related just makes it even cuter for the relationship in Ticket to Paradise almost as if in a fantasy way they were married. Beautiful all around highly entertaining throughout and I didn't expect to barely be able to get a spot to sit; plus I biked home that was satisfying!"
TICKET TO PARADISE,"A pretentious and unearned ""romantic comedy"" The trailer made this movie look much better than it was. The star leads could not hold this film together to save their lives. I think I like George Clooney less now than before I saw the film. His character was the absolute worst human being I've seen on film in recent memory. In fact, all of the characters besides Billie Lorde's were hard to like, and she's in the background for most of the film, which was sad because she was only there for comic relief. The only positive thing I have to say about the film is that it ended. Pretentious, predictable and downright lazy. The romance between the two leads was not believable in the slightest, same with the couple we are supposed to be rooting for. Whoever wrote this film must not love anything but themselves because they surely did not convey any sort of real love between anyone here. I've seen Hallmark movies that were better and more warm hearted than this. Plus all the hateful rhetoric for America underlining the whole thing was sickening. Even Julia Roberts character denounces America at one point in the film. Just disrespectful and pretentious. Forget about the money, I want my two hours back!"
TICKET TO PARADISE,"Predictable and Dull I wanted to like this movie because of the actors, but there is nothing to like. Just recycled scenes from similar romantic comedy movies. The shtick fails to entertain and unfortunately the slapstick gags come across as forced and desperate.
 The clever banter (which takes the place of any real character development) between Clooney and Roberts gets old very fast. The main characters lack depth.
 The sound editing makes it hard to hear the dialogue and some of the actors mumble their lines.
 I give 3 stars for the beautiful setting. Was any of it authentic? I don't know. I hope they didn't offend the Balinese people with this movie.
 Watch something else."
TICKET TO PARADISE,"Entertained yes George & Julia have done it again. Most likely good friends in real life it shows the electricity is there. Set in Bali however shot in north Queensland. If you have been to Bali and north Qld. You will pick the difference in the torain. The vista shots are a big part of the movie well done. The movie reminds you of The Descendants a Clooney movie of years back shot on Hawaii similar yarn and visuals. George looks great and age is kind to him. Julia still presents well in a swim cozie. They both have the best smile and use it to advantage. Other players do a fine job the new husband is a Ken Doll. A light piece of theatre that must be seen on the big screen for full effect. The two classic actors did entertain me Easy to look at.
 Patrick."
TICKET TO PARADISE,"Clooney and Roberts are quite a good team A former married couple (George Clooney and Julia Roberts) who at the moment can't stand each other, decide to go together to Bali for there daughters (Kaitlyn Dever) wedding, but fearing she is making a mistake, they decide to put there differences aside in hopes to stop the wedding.
 George Clooney and Julia Roberts are just an awesome team. You can cleary see both are having fun making this film. Bali setting is well seen. The comedy comes pretty well, with a little heart too it. Kaitlyn Dever is okay has the daughter, but it's Billie Lourd has Devers friend that kind of steals the movie. It's an entertaining film, not a masterpiece."
TICKET TO PARADISE,"Appalling. Is this ad-lib? Unrehearsed trash. I hate ad-lib films, I don't know but this must be, like they were making it up as they went along. Amateurish, stupid and poorly acted. The only decent part is the scenary.
 The direction is chaotic as is the cinematography, it's like they were in a rush to complete.
 The so called jokes were as funny as herpes and due to the ad-lib nature fell flat.
 Where have all the quality films gone? I hate to say this but cinema has died a death in favour of cheap streaming movies. I believe that most cinemas will close as there is literally nothing on worth paying the ticket price.
 Trash like this shouldn't even be put to streaming, let alone the big screen."
JUST GO WITH IT,"Forget It This terrible remake of I.A.L. Diamond's work on Cactus Flower back in 1969, itself based on an excellent stage play, was difficult to sit through: Too long, too unfunny, and to formulaic. Relying on sight gags and stale jokes cannot save a bad film, much less a screenplay that probably required very little effort on the part of the writers. Of late, much of what's coming out of Hollywood reeks of paranoia. When one is afraid to take a risk, in the genre of romantic comedies, remake something that was successful years ago. This travesty is indicative such a mentality. Also, when will Jennifer A. wake up and stop getting herself involved in films that will do little for her career? Save your money and rent Cactus Flower. Trust me, you'll be happy you did."
JUST GO WITH IT,"Totally predictable, poor writing, sorry acting There isn't much to be said. Brooklyn Decker is nice looking but that's about the only redeeming feature of this movie which is the worst I've seen in a long time. Some poor casting and worse writing makes this one close to unbearable. You know right from the opening scenes that you're going to be in for a long night. Jennifer Anniston proves once again that she is one dimensional and the rest of the cast isn't much different. I did enjoy however the scenes with Nicole Kidman and Dave Matthews because at least if was something a little different. Save yourself the time and the money, because let's face it - one way or another, you've seen this movie before."
JUST GO WITH IT,"Unfunny Abysmal Movie! I had the misfortune of sitting through this movie with an elderly patient and his wife. NO ONE laughed much in the entire theater.
 The jokes were obviously written either by a 12 year old boy or someone with brain damage.
 Why does Jennifer Aniston keep playing the SAME character over and over? Adam Sandler is supposed to be a plastic surgeon and Aniston his assistant. Their unprofessional behavior would have me running from this office. Jokes were stupid and crude. Sandler fakes being married to pick up women because he was hurt years ago at his wedding. Stupid premise to begin with and it just got worse and worse.
 Nicole Kidman did nothing to liven up this dreary mess.
 Avoid this like the plague unless you are into sadomasochism."
JUST GO WITH IT,Horrible premise horribly dished up
JUST GO WITH IT,"Dumb and Offensive Why do people always say ""I just want to be entertained"" when talking about a horrible movie? As if anything that isn't completely moronic couldn't possibly be entertaining. This movie didn't have a single shred of honesty or humanity. The plot seemed to come directly from some Microsoft program that creates boilerplate scenarios for lame romantic comedies. And why does every movie have to be about rich creeps? I'm certainly no Bolshevik but I am thoroughly sick of watching movies about people who live in mansions and spend $1,000 on a single pair of shoes. When was the last time you saw a movie about someone who had a normal job?"
JUST GO WITH IT,"Garbage acting Wow... this was painful and I had to give up after 50 minutes. It was obvious how it ended so I didn't even need to wait for it.
 Your standard Adam Sandler flick where he plays the same character every single time. He still sucks at acting and everyone around him is either equally bad or barely passable. Watch it if you like suffering."
JUST GO WITH IT,"what can i say... Initially when i was watching this movie, had great hopes on it. And slowly in my mind i started predicting what happens next. with little insight in my head i realized ... hey the movie is copied from some dumb Bollywood movie. now can u beat that. i thought Bollywood is suppose to have this kind of business line. and the worst thing is they didn't change anything. really a disappointment on that part with the lost of originality. the flow of the movie is good and ya it is funny at times. but i couldn't help my self but rate this movie 1 because of the fact that the story line is not original.
 save your money and time .."
JUST GO WITH IT,"WoW This Sucked The Adam Sandler days are over. I thought Grown Ups would of been the end of it but he had to make this piece of crap too. Sandler continues to come across as a fat, arrogant, rich Jew who doesn't give a crap about anything which probably isn't too far from who he is in real life. I hate to be so hard on him because Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore were gold. But this movie is just a major waist of time. Even the gratuitous shots of Any Roddick's wife weren't enough to carry even the slightest interest in the plot. Throw in the one dimensional Aniston and Dave Mathew's first acting appearance ever, and you've got a sleeper. If you want to still think highly of Sandler, don't watch this and put Billy Madison back in the VCR instead."
JUST GO WITH IT,"Sorry Adam & Jennifer - You've wasted 2 hours of my life Whilst I wouldn't regard myself as a Sandler fan, I've watched most of his films over the years, and some are even excellent to barely acceptable - a fairly good record considering the amount he has put out since he started. Just Go With It, well, I won't mince my words is just atrociously bad - badly acted, badly directed, badly scripted. In fact I would go far as to say this was my razzie awards film of the year. I guess the clue was already in the title, possibly pleading fans for patience whilst watching it. Sorry Adam & Jennifer, this was sheer self- indulgent dribble, poor and very weak. How the hell Nicole Kidman got caught up in his script, beggars belief or any decision of good common sense. Was she forcibly made to do this? I see no other reason for her wanting this role. The script is so full of utter implausibilities, so stupidly riddled with holes, (not at all funny as Sandler can be), I felt insulted, violated, when watching this film, squandering 2 precious hours of my life which could have been occupied with much anything else - that's how meaningless of any entertainment value I think this piece of utter junk is worth."
JUST GO WITH IT,Was the movie made on 'opposite day'?
JUST GO WITH IT,"Awful just isn't a strong enough word God awful. I would appreciate it if the film industry didn't capitulate to the demand for horrendous endeavours such as this one. This ""movie"" makes Matthew McConaughey look like Daniel Day Lewis, and Fool's Gold like Citizen Kane. Overall, I am hard pressed to blame Hollywood and the screen play writers for producing this farce of a plot, as the people inexplicably yearn for such cringe worthy clich√©s and egregious character development, and back stories. The much lauded and acclaimed acting performances of Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston culminate in this 'piece de resistance', unlikely to be bettered this millennia. Good luck at the Academy Awards, as a Best Screenplay and Best Actor reward are positively assured."
JUST GO WITH IT,"Awful One of the worst films I have ever seen. I don't know how they got Kidman or Aniston to do this film! Especially when you compare it with some of the amazing comedies these actresses have been in. I love most Aniston films but I couldn't sit through this.It lacked her witty humour and the edge she and Kidman usually bring.
 The only appeal I could see is that guys had a lot to stare at a lot of attractive women looking attractive? The sets looked plastic, the whole film looked plastic. The plot was full of inconsistencies.
 It had the aesthetic of Nutty Professor meets Wedding Singer but nowhere near as funny.The only answer I can come up with is perhaps this doesn't translate well to British audiences? Awful."
JUST GO WITH IT,"I usually love Adam Sandler's films, but.. I don't go out to the movies that much, usually watch at home, but I bought two tickets at 10 bucks each and brought my wife to this movie. I want my money back, and the two missing hours of my life.
 Bad acting, bad script, bad jokes, and completely unrealistic in every way. Brooklyn Decker's character is made to look like a complete idiot, beyond what one would believe possible. And so many lies, the truth seemed so much more obvious, and so much easier to explain.
 My wife was wondering if it was written for kids, but there is an awful lot of sexual content for that to be the case. Not sure who this movie is for. Also, I knew from the very beginning of this movie what the final outcome was going to be. Along with the punchlines to the jokes, you could see it a mile away. Sorry Adam, this one is a major turkey."
JUST GO WITH IT,"a bad parody on Cactus Flower One can see Hollywood's obvious decline here. They took a charmy, gracious comedy from 1969 and made it into a cheap,tasteless farce. It is like taking over a first rate French restaurant and convert it into McDonalds. Shopping in expensive boutiques is obviously the ultimate dream for the sort of people this movie is targeting. Sad..."
JUST GO WITH IT,"Very, Very Bad"
JUST GO WITH IT,"Yet another ego film by Adam Sandler It is a typical Adam Sandler movie. He is cruel to children until he gets to know them, all the pretty woman fall in love with him despite him being a liar and a all around despicable human being. But the worst part of this movie is the female/gay bashing which is the signature of all his films.
 His love interest, Jennifer Aniston is a smart. Beautiful woman who doesn't take his crap. But he can't see the beauty inside of her until she gets a make over at a spa... now all of a sudden she is pretty enough for him. How is that possible? Seriously?
 Then there is the hula scene where a plus size woman is competing for a dance contest. Of course because she is plus size, they refer to her as ugly or as a man. It's disgraceful. Honestly how Nicole Kidman am and jennifer Aniston can be in this film is beyond me.
 But if that's not enough, there is the gay bashing which Inevitably ends up in every Adam Sandler movie. Because if your gay you just can't be a real man right???
 It's awful. Adam Sandler and his ego. It's horrible."
JUST GO WITH IT,"Typical woman Bashing Adam Sandler This is yet another typical Adam Sandler movie. Jennifer Aniston isn't pretty enough because she doesn't use makeup, so she under goes a transformation maker over. (As if a paper bag could hide her good looks). After the makeover, she is now worthy to be his one and only. Before that can happen, he bashes plus size woman, demeans ever woman he sees with lies, abuses the female child of Aniston's character... never the son though... and no one is hot enough for him unless they can wear a bikini in public. Please....
 This whole movie is a stroke to Adam Sandler's ego and it's nauseating at best."
JUST GO WITH IT,"Unless you're 40-50 years old, this is not funny! I thought the preview looked good, and I love Adam Sandler (like many of us do) but I thought this movie was awful! Very dumb, not funny at all! The 40-50 year olds were laughing constantly and I wasn't sure why. My friend and I would look at each other and ask ""what's so funny""? ""why is everyone laughing""? Normally if a movie is bad I stay because a.why not? I paid 8 bucks for entertainment and b.just so I can see how it ends, so with that being said...I never walk out of movies, but I was bored and couldn't take it anymore so we ended up walking out to watch the Red Wings game =) I don't know how people are rating this movie so high!"
JUST GO WITH IT,"One Laugh.......Would Have Been Nice.....But There Were None It was only recently that i found out...Rom--Coms were actually called ""date movies"". This is...i suppose...a date movie. This is a movie which has NO LAUGHS. Maybe that is what they went for...a date movie with no laughs. Perhaps the thinking here was...no other date movie has any laughs, why should we be different. Adam Sandler has done so many of these, that he has stopped acting in them. He just goes around with a pronounced silly look in his face. Jenifer Aniston never WAS funny, so she just becomes a more tired looking version of herself. To watch this, and to listen to the dreadful script could take a couple of points off your I.Q. I never even dreamed that movies could be so awful. Call them Rom-Coms---call them date movies, but mostly ---call them utter rubbish."
JUST GO WITH IT,"Held captive on Non stop flight by this movie It had to happen...the pairing of my least favorite actress with the untalented Adam Sandler, whose career has mystified me even since I first saw him on SNL. Here they are, hemming and hawing their way thru an unscripted string of under-rehearsed comedy sketches whose unifying link is their crass lack of originality and pointlessness. This movie generated 0.0 of the warmth a romantic comedy should. I despised ALL of the characters from the opening moments until the credits rolled. I guess United Airlines wanted to show a movie that would equally offend and not entertain everyone on the flight. I like smutty jokes and sexual humor if it's funny but this was a big nothing. If anyone wonders why our schools are out of control and falling apart, you could look to a film like this to understand how we suffer if this is what is pawned off as entertainment............. Quit grinding out movies like Corned Beef Hash and write a script...go to rehearsal...learn to act"
JUST GO WITH IT,"Awful, Gawd awful"
JUST GO WITH IT,"Hard to Watch I think it is too bad that movies like this give the actors such a big paycheck. This must be the one and only reason for these horrible movies to be made. They are very poorly written and very poorly acted and so many people go to see them . Of course we all have our own opinions and what I say may be wrong and this may indeed be a good movie but I don't think so. If this movie just disappeared and did not exist the world may not ever notice. This is a movie that should have been shown on a local TV channel and not at a theater, and the actors should have been paid a lot less and then they may not have made such garbage? No acting ability , no story, dull to watch and yet the stars were paid many millions for their skills. Too bad.."
JUST GO WITH IT,Not good to plagiarise Saw this movie a while back and was shocked to see that it was a remake of an Indian blockbuster movie from 2005. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0451803/ Believe me its a scene to scene copy of the original and at least the makers should have credited it to be an inspiration or a remake. Rated this awful not because of the acting or he storytelling but just for the above mentioned fact. The movie is quite good. Adam Sandler suits his role and shows once again that when it comes to comedy he is one of the very best in the business. Go watch it if you want to but I would recommend watching the original as it contains more visually appealing music numbers.
JUST GO WITH IT,Another dud from Adam Sandler
JUST GO WITH IT,Just don't watch it.
LEAP YEAR,Biggest load of vomit inducing nonsense I've ever seen!
LEAP YEAR,"An absolute shamble This movie has resulted in me missing two hours of my life. The director portrays Ireland( The Republic of Ireland) as a stagnant backwater from a bygone era, and its people unrivaled in unsophistication! The Cliffs of Moher are in the Burren, not Connemara, nor Kerry! You would be more likely to meet a herd of S500's on the Dublin road from Dingle than a herd of cattle(I mean the main road, that was no where near a main road.
 Despite the recent recession, in the 3 areas of GDP Ireland is ranked 8th on the International Monetary Fund(IMF), 5TH on World Bank and 10th according to the CIA Fact Book. One would not conclude this from this ""so called'representation of Ireland today.
 Apart from the total unrealistic stage, the story was clich√© and predictable. I suggest the producers finish their ""homework"" next time and actually do some research on a country in which they wish to set their film."
LEAP YEAR,"So bad it's almost racist This is one of the most shockingly bad movies I've ever seen. I love Amy Adams more than the women in my own family and really thought that I could watch her in just about anything-Junebug, Enchanted, Charlie Wilson's War-she really does bring some sparkle into whatever she gets her teeth into. Here however, she can, at best, be described as a flower growing on a dung-heap.
 There is no plot-what plot there is is pure run-of-the-mill tripe. The image it portrays of Ireland is actually kind of racist. Yes I'm Irish, but an ardent nationalist I am not. But the characters in this movie are a mix between what Americans thought Irish people were 100 years ago (save the anti-British republicanism) and what the stupider Irish ""heros"" were in bad Irish folklore, a la Darby of Gill. A hairdryer, a contraption so modern and so powerful that the Irish electrical grid cannot handle it, manages to cause a black-out in the town of Dingle, which seems to only consist of one pub/hotel and four cottages. It takes the protagonists days to drive from Kerry to Dublin, a feat which takes about 4 hours. 5 max. The men are superstitious fools, obsessed with black cats and omens attached to different days of the week, while others are thieves and brigands. Matthew Goode's accent is possibly the worst attempt at an Irish accent since Julia Roberts in Mary Reilly. Strike that. It's definitely worse. Oh, also there is no public transport in Ireland so to speak.
 The little pickles that they get into along the way are idiotic. The dialogue is cringe-worthy. And I love a good chick-flick. As long as its good. Give me Notting Hill any day of the week.
 Amy Adams, shame on you, please don't let me down again. The only way this film could be described as being in any way good is if it was so bad it was good. But I think it gets there and then it becomes a case of its so bad its good, for a minute but then it gets so bad that its just plain bad. Avoid, unless planning to play some form a drinking game with it whereby a drink is taken every time some inaccurate stereotype associated with Irishness is propounded.
 Wait. Did I just propound an inaccurate stereotype associated with Irishness by suggesting you use the movie as the basis for a drinking game? Well, maybe they're not that inaccurate........"
LEAP YEAR,"Lame, lame, lame"
LEAP YEAR,Lame.
LEAP YEAR,"So many mistakes, it's not even a romantic comedy anymore‚Äîit's worse I tend to like most romantic comedies. I really disliked Leap Year.
 Anna is our main character, successful but not-yet-engaged. She's desperate to get married (one of the many aspects of her character that bothered me), so we are off to Ireland to propose to her boyfriend Jeremy. Cue all the problems. I was prepared for all the ridiculous obstacles in getting to Dublin, but I wasn't prepared for Anna's extreme selfishness in forcing everybody she meets to get her there. Because I found Anna so unlikeable, I couldn't find the humour in any of the contrived (not actually existent) travel problems in Ireland.
 Ireland is a great setting, but they didn't really show us any part of it. Every time they had an opportunity for a beautiful wide shot of the countryside, they instead filled the screen with Amy Adams' and Matthew Goode's faces. Sure they are pretty, but Ireland is prettier.
 This movie also had a lot of mistakes. All the geography of Ireland that they tried to show us was wrong. The bit of back-story that they gave for Anna was contrary to the selfish, superficial girl she is.
 I am the target audience for this movie, and yet I hated it. I can't find a single redeeming quality of this movie, so I think they missed the mark big time."
LEAP YEAR,"Diddlee-eyeing its way across Ireland Found this gem through it being mentioned on the Motherfocl√≥ir podcast. Not since the execrable 'Sons of Anarchy' has there been such a fever-dream version of Ireland. There's a stripe of American who thinks the country is stuck 50 years in the past forever. Note to such 'auteurs': there's a wonderful new search website called ""go ogle"". You can type things into ""go ogle"" like
 ""What does Dingle look like?"" or ""Do Irish people have celphones?"" or ""Do Irish people eat tripe?"" or ""How long does it take to sail from Cardiff to Dingle?"" or ""What kinds of cars do the Irish drive? or ""Do Irish buses run on Sunday?"", etc etc etc
 First the big stuff: unlikeable characters (OK to start with them, not OK to end with them). Character arc, baby. We used to do them.
 But it's the portrayal of Ireland that was phantasmagorical, even by Hollywood standards. The yokel pub scene is to be expected. The 'comic yokel relief' of the aul lads arguing was stale shtick, but the drunken man falling over was gross. Yeah, he was going to drive her to dublin but he was too drunk to walk, hahaha the irish amirite? Actually no you're not. Biggest tea drinkers are not the English but the Irish, and the biggest drinkers are the English not the Irish. Go ogle.
 So her flight can't land in Dublin (apparently the only airport in Ireland). Could have just landed in Shannon. Oh wait we can't afford a research assistant.
 ""Go ogle: other airports in Ireland"" would have told them about Shannon and presto our character is in ""deh wesht"" and can enjoy the bucolic delights of Tuam. But no, in Hollywood there is only one airport, so we must redirect to wales. Where (contrary to fact) welsh people are awful.
 The opening insanity is the boat trip from Cardiff (there are no ferries from Cardiff, you'd leave from Holyhead, but I guess Americans wouldn't understand that). Still, even in the big ships that's a 2 hour travel time at least, but the Bauld Amy commandeers a small fishing ship and manages to reach Dingle (on the opposite side of Ireland) with time to spare. If the short trip is 2 hours in a huge ferry, she's surely losing at least half a day or a day with her cinematic trip to the wrong side of the country. Or, she could have waited for the next flight.
 But I guess they wanted to get her to 'Deh Real Oireland' where ""Deh real Oirish"" still live.
 Fever-dream stuff.
 It goes downhill from there. I found the atmosphere anything but charming, actually intensely claustrophobic. In a country with one (old) car, maybe two, the inability to manage a very simple trip to Dublin actually feels Kafkaesque. The constant phone-on-the-wall business was just deranged, in a country where there are more mobile phones than people - by 2010 the market was saturated. The P&T boxes = whatever production company was dressing the sets must have been amazed to find out that they were working on a movie set in 2010, and not 1990.
 There's so much to mention: the gruesome dinner kissing scene with the Italians. No conservative Irish couple would be OK with that - they'd squirm. Certainly none of the ""go on ya boy ya give yer wife a good one yaroo!"" madness. Don't get me started on the tripe. Isn't that more of a Northern English thing? Circa 1965?
 Compulsory fight scene (because deh oirish dey're always foitin). Oh, god, the scene where Declan and the guy in the van spit and shake on their deal - no, hollywood, just no. Please stop, I'm asking nicely. Please.
 The band he was playing in the care was a Boston American-Irish group, so we know this isn't exactly being marketed to the Irish. But I think the most despicable aspect of the film was the way Declan accuses her of ""diddley-eyeing"" her way across the country.
 No Decko, it's the bloody movie that's doing that."
LEAP YEAR,"Don't be fooled by the fluffy reviews on here This film was really, really painfully bad. To give you an idea, I watched it a few months ago and the badness really stuck with me, enough so to specifically join up to IMDb to write my first review on how rubbish it was now. At the time it was scoring a 6 on IMDb so it seemed like there might be some element of enjoyment to be had from it - after all I was really not expecting that much from a rom-com anyway. Little did I know. The plot was ridiculous (and i'm allowing for the fact that rom-com plots are often silly). The characters are detestable and you don't give a hoot what happens to them, though the outcome is obvious the whole way through. Some people have said on here it is not your average rom-com. I would agree - it is far worse."
LEAP YEAR,Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
LEAP YEAR,Is that really a movie?
LEAP YEAR,"The most awful ""love"" story This is one of the reasons so many people get into toxic relationships, these kind of films portraying something you should actually run from and the movie showing it off as romantic. Can't help but cringe."
LEAP YEAR,Horrendous The paddy whackery depiction of the Irish is one thing that some US productions use and this is no exception. The plot is absurd and acting is at best average. Awful awful script.
LEAP YEAR,"The most offensive film ever released If you know anything about Irish people, culture or geography, you will hate this film from the minute a fishing boat travelling from Cardiff to Cork has to stop in Dingle (on the other side of the country) to the phone boxes from the 1980s still on every street corner in Dublin."
LEAP YEAR,"wtf ? predictable, boring, so stupid ... stupid movie... okay story but boring and yes so damn predictable .. the Indian version dat they say is a remake of this movie is way way way better and yes it is a award winning movie der... this movie made me feel like i wasted my time so bad ... seriously ... jab we met "" so called Indian version"" is better entertaining and yes a lil different but i would still see it a million times but no this ... awful!!!!!! !!!!! !!!! !!!!!! !!!!! yuck!1 * only .. i wish a negative star was der to give this movie one ..... see some other movie but not this ... some how the reason why i wanted to see his movie was dat my frnd told me a Indian movie is a copy of this movie so i did and i regret it .."
LEAP YEAR,"The Worst A man would have to love a woman a whole bunch to sit all the way through this scenic piece of garbage. It is like a travelogue of Ireland, but with no plot or character development. Almost every shot is of beautiful scenery, but you could watch the movie with the sound turned down. A person could go through all of the reviews of this movie and determine the gender of the reviewer by the number of stars they give this movie. The movie is absolutely painful. I cannot mention the name of this movie because the title of the movie is the entire plot. I have never seen such a thin plot. Absolutely nothing happens. I could feel all my testosterone draining out of me each minute that passed in this movie. Guys, go at your own risk."
LEAP YEAR,"Absolutely terrible Yeah, no. This is one of the most idiotic movies I've seen in decades. I'm a fan of every one in the cast so I put this absolute waste of time on while I ordered DoorDash.
 Everyone is a complete subhuman dingbat is this quagmire of a plot. Nothing is believed or relatable or even funny in any way whatsoever the only quasi novel thing about this dross is it ability to fail in ways I hadn't thought possible.
 The writing is so trite and unimaginative that each idiot has zero chance at being remotely interesting. Every ounce of charm has been wrought out of the story by a dialogue that is so cliched that even a bottle of whiskey would be of no help.
 From start to finish this is a waste is cellular ATP."
LEAP YEAR,"Tripe (And I'm not talking about the recipe.) Every cliche in the book. Declan is a jerk, Anna is an idiot, and the whole thing is unwatchable. The scenery is pretty, but the film a waste of a good cast."
LEAP YEAR,"This is NOT Ireland The movie is poor even of its genre, which is saying something. There is no plot and the acting is well, terrible. However how this movie portrays Ireland is not only wildly inaccurate its bordering on offensive."
LEAP YEAR,"ONLY award won by two AMERICAN screenwriters? Worst screenplay! This low-earning movie does not seem to have covered its production and promotion costs.
 The many well-written reviews in the 1-3 star range here are mostly by aggrieved folks from Ireland - a country knee-deep in great writing talent - who rightly say the Irish and their incessant straight-faced humor are nothing like what we see in this rather nasty put-down of a movie - of one of the most successful economies in Europe. Not even one smart Irish person is shown.
 Instead of Irish writers? We have Americans Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont with little track record - inexplicably selected, as they have only ever won one award, for worst screenplay! For ""Surviving Christmas"" at the 2005 Raspberry awards.
 Very glad the superb Amy Adams (net worth $60m and 6 Oscar nominations) absolutely shrugged this one off. Sadly Matthew Goode (net worth $2 million and a winner of only one award, the 2014 Fangoria Chainsaw Award for best supporting actor) fared not so well thereafter. He feared his character would be scorned not least by real Irish - and was right."
LEAP YEAR,"Worst.Movie.Ever Id rather watch my mom go to the loo, a cow give birth, someone strangle a child or."
LEAP YEAR,"Couldn't bare it .. not even for an hour 45 minutes... That's how long I bared with it...I mean, could it be more cliche??? I just wanted a chill evening with a feel good movie to go with it... And what I got, was only confusion and tiredness . Could she have a worse luck? Make a movie people, but at least make it even a little bit believable.. A NO NO for me"
LEAP YEAR,"Pure garbage This movie is not worth watching ever for any reason. I implore you to find a different movie to watch...any movie. Just not this one. Awful, unfunny, terrible acting, terrible plot, terrible everything that makes a movie. I can't believe money and recourses were spent on this."
LEAP YEAR,"I hate this movie!!! Look, I get it - chick flicks are rarely good movies. But this one sucked. There was no chemistry, the plot was contrived, the characters had no likability, and the fetishization of Ireland was disgusting. I wouldn't recommend this to torture my worst enemy. Thank god Amy Adams has realized her mistake and moved onto bigger, better things."
LEAP YEAR,"Boring What a waste of time! I love movies and chose to watch this cuz was recorded in Ireland, the only good thing about this movie was the nature scenes, the rest were garbage."
LEAP YEAR,"If you're looking for an adorable, funny, romantic comedy then this is not it I can easily say that the 30 minutes I spent attempting to watch this film before I gave up, was without a doubt the biggest waste in a long time. Comedy is without a doubt down to personal opinion however in order to have an opinion the subject must be funny to begin with. I challenge anyone to get through the whole film without either falling asleep or turning it off. Best of luck to all!
 JS"
BLACK ADAM,"Disjointed CGI mess Wow. The fact that someone read this script and approved it is astounding. Even worse, is that they saw the final product and said, ""Yeah, this is OK. Let's go with this"". This makes your average CGI suckfest look like Citizen Kane.
The writing was horrible, the acting was atrocious (Pierce Bronson, please fire your agent), the costumes were laughable (Rock's outfit desrves a Razzie by itself), and the plot was just......bad.
The only characters that weren't wooden and unlikable were the Uncle and Atom Smasher. Growing up, I loved Hawkman. His portrayal here was just embarrassing. He made Bruce Wayne look poor and Tony Stark look humble.
Everyone associated with this trainwreck should be ashamed. Well, except for the Uncle and Atom Smasher."
BLACK ADAM,"Wow is this bad I love the Rock. But this movie is just boring, stupid and overdone.
Sorry Dwayne!
Horrible directing, bad acting, bad timing with any type of humor.
Geez.
I sound awful writing this, sorry.
It's just that bad.
Special FX is bad. Obviously cost some $ to get done, but it's like the B crew was on this one.
I love Sarah Shahi as an actress. This is a waste of her talents.
What was good? I just couldn't find anything. I tried, I kept watching, I walked away and came back. I drank a few cocktails. Nothing changed my mind.
Good luck to everybody in this film. I hope it does well, but it sucks."
BLACK ADAM,Black adam is a cringe fest 
BLACK ADAM,"Must be on crack to enjoy this. Boring. Cliched. Boring. Lame. Boring and also we kept wondering what is this that we are watching.
Wanted to leave the theater , still want to.
Writing this during the film so that I don't fall asleep.
We did leave right before the end. We could not stand it afterall.
On a very serious note, it was such a lukewarm attempt at a making the film worthy if any attention. The references were all over. It seemed like the actors themselves were bored. Dialogues were weak. The story was even weaker.
A climax never happened and the movie never got better.
Nothing came together. Just a water effort. It could have been nice with what they were trying to imply with the occupation forces and the white savior complex but sadly very sad attempt."
BLACK ADAM,"Worse than a low budget superhero trash movie I have trouble understanding the praise. Right off the batt, the movie starts with mediocre cinematography, cheap CGI, terrible narration, and subpar acting. But I decided to suspend my irritation and give it a fair chance
Wow, I should trust my intuition much more! The movie turned to be super-cliche super-hero, with some Marvel elements for garnish. Why would Dwayne get himself in such an uniteresting mess!
I expected Sarah Shahi to do much better. Rather she turned out to be one of the major excellence inhibitors in the movie
I know, I know. Many dudes here will rate this review as unuseful. Fine, I understand where you come from. Many youngsters enjoy style so much that they loose interest in quality substance. The problem is that this movie doesn't even have any distinguished style! Many 2000's medium budget movie were much better produced and acted!"
BLACK ADAM,"Yet another watered down bastardisation ""The film initially received an R rating due to several gruesome death scenes and many cuts had to be made to the film to receive the lower PG-13 rating""
^ That is all you need to know about this movie. A team of executives, producers, writers a director, an entire team of absurdly over paid people pitched an idea for a movie based on a comic character.
They then hired writers to take certain elements and plot lines from the characters long history and make a movie out of it.
They then hired directors, the highest paid yet most one dimensional ""actor"" in history to front it.
They spent months having re-writes and changes. Spent months filming scenes over and over again. When they were happy with it it was sent to post production where a team of very highly paid people plastered the movie in special effects.
They had it in a studio for weeks to months with music being composed, overlayed, sound lines being re-recorded, foley's producing sounds for movements and atmosphere. Then all of the audio was mixed and overlayed in a way they were happy with
And then what happened? They took a finished product that they were content was a good vehicle to tell the story and completely buthcered it. Removed any scene that had the character acting like the character he is supposed to be, removed any and all scenes that could possibly be deemed as ""too much"" for a child by the ridiculous american MPAA. They watered down and hacked chunks out of their own product to sell more tickets, even though it was already guaranteed to be a financial success since it has the rocks name attached to it. They destroyed a story that they themselves had concocted and the end result is a completely different end product than what was pitched and even different from what was originally filmed it's dumb it is completely and utterly moronic. If you don't want to make an R rated movie and want to make yet another generic child focused brightly coloured, pun filled movie that has about as much depth as an episode of peppa the pig then do that. Don't take a character who historically has had stories revolving around adult themes, shoot an entire movie retaining the essence of the character and then proceeding to intentionally destroy any semblence of that character or the themes you were part of creating in the first place.
I don't care for the rock personally, zero acting ability and a selfish attention seeker in real life, but this movie could and should've been good, he can't act at all but he already has the ego and arrogance that could fit this character, instead we get the most generic, predictable and low effort childish movie that DC has ever churned out."
BLACK ADAM,"terrible movie.. Is just bad DC keeps doing in... Expending massive amounts of money on entirely pointless titles, and projects without a soul, which lets you thinking that you just have been stolen from 2h of your life... The movie is shallow, with equally flat characters, that literally copy from everybody else.. It feels like a project driven by marketers and data analytics with the only goal of trying to make enough noise (with big-name actors, busy VFX, and cheap jokes) to make viewers expend time and money on an experience they will forget as soon as the movie wrap up. It's pathetic how this studio has lost their way and his brand trying to chase the success that other studios has found. We need more artist, more soul, and risk and less marketing BS!!"
BLACK ADAM,"Wanted to rate this a zero but couldn't figure out how... The best thing to say about this movie is that it would save a teacher a lot of time in leading a class on film-making. Rather than dredging through hours of film to demonstrate to students what types of characteristic features are most prominent in poorly executed movies, the teacher could simply show this movie and tick every box.
Characters in near death situations who have been poorly introduced and whom the audience doesn't care about? Tick Ham-fisted attempts at humour that fall flat? Tick An incoherent plot? Tick Over-blown cgi? Tick Over-reliance on the over-blown cgi? Tick Lackluster acting from all players? Tick Plot points and characters which only make sense when connected to other intellectual property? Tick Contains every cliche from every other film ever made? Tick
In one way I have to give Black Adam a certain level of respect in actually being this bad. It's not bad as in a stupid movie that sucks but that suckiness is what makes it enjoyable. It's just bad bad.
This is incredibly difficult to write without sounding hyperbolic but this is the worst film I've ever seen."
BLACK ADAM,"A Kid Wrote This Script I feel intellectually insulted after watching this cliche filled, money wasting, and slower than a sloth piece of junk.
Why TF did I waste my precious Friday night watching this in the cinema??? If God gave me another chance, I would have given these tickets to the people I hate the most as a gift. Because I know they will suffer from watching the worst acting in humankind history.
The movie feels like it's Avengers but bought on WISH, and it feels so cheap that my grandma in China even knows its a knockoff version.
I want to use this movie in my future film classes to show how not to make a movie. This is the perfect example of how to treat your audience like kindergarten toddlers."
BLACK ADAM,What a friggin let down. 
BLACK ADAM,"Black Adam.... Blacklisted I came into this movie with high hopes with a good cast. The film was terrible. After 10 minutes I couldn't wait for it to finish. The plot was all over the place and DC have done what they always do, throw a ton of characters and plots and explosions in without really fully explaining any kind of back story.
Dwayne Johnson I normally like, but he literally looked like he was reading off an autocue all the way through. The best character was Pierce Brosnan's but again because there was no explanation of any back story I can't even remember the characters name. Awful film. Wouldn't watch again."
BLACK ADAM,"Lame movie I did not like this movie and was surprised that The Rock would be acting in a very onedimensional role. I had colleagues telling me that watching this movie would be a waste of time - I didn't believe them at first but now I can confirm they were right.
Even though hero movies (Marvel etc) are ""over the top"" with the super powers and all, this film lacked the refined touch and depth of those movies.
I had the feeling that The Rock didn't actually want to take part in this movie but had to because he was bound by some contract or something. His usual energy and ""presence"" (if you get what I'm trying to express) was somehow missing.
Maybe just a feeling but that is my impression."
BLACK ADAM,"Walked out in under 45 minutes This movie was so bad that it's not even worth a review, except to say no acting, all CGI, must be desperate for an income, else can't explain why Dwayne would put his name to it. Both my husband and myself felt that it was such a waste of money towards Marvel rubbish futuristic green screen movies. They lack a plot, looks like Dwayne is wearing half a dress and pants and can't act to save his life. He used to stand for a bit of comedy and a good laugh. Lockdown must have cooked his acting skills, quite clear from the dribble he tweeted during lockdown that put me right off him & I used to be a fan."
BLACK ADAM,Wanna be Infinity war Wanna be marvel the a fight scene reminds me of infinity war marvel hawk man (hawk eye ) dr fate (dr strange Adam smasher ( dead pool wanna be suit with ant man powers nothing has been good since the peacemaker show I wish I could you the time stone and go back cause I like both universe but I mean dc is slacking. I will stick with marvel until peacemaker season 2 comes out or another suicide squad film cause I liked the last one also I like titans so I mean I ain't gonna complain so much about those but this come on man stop trying to copy marvel this movie biggest waste of god damn time come on dc step it up.
BLACK ADAM,"Not to sound like an ass hole but Not to sound like a cynical movie nerd but this movie was BORING I'm just glad I have regal unlimited so I got to see it for free but dude it was bad
Basic, boring emotionless acting (especially from the rock)
This movie just felt like it kept dragging on with a boring done to death every super hero movie ever theme with a lame plot that I know I've seen before somewhere.
I just wish they woulda done something else or at least tried to redeem themselves with this one because I was really hyped for it but it was a sad disappointment I'm afraid..
The villain was cliche and this movie was over all whack and cheesy.. goodnight New York thanks for listening in kiddos!"
BLACK ADAM,"DC should stop making movie This movie shows that DC should really stop making movies. It's hilariously bad on many level. Also they shouldn't have casted Dwayne Johnson. That guy is obviously still Dwayne no matter what role he is in.
Why would Black Adam throw jokes such as, ""I waited for you before dropping those bad guys"" or ""The man in black said Hi?"" This guy was supposed to living a hellish live of a slave his whole life. And it should still feel like yesterday that he lost his child and wife. Why would he listen to a dumb suggestion made by a teenager?
Also a fat man with leg problem and a skinny mom can beat up a lot of skeleton soldiers from hell? A squad of soldiers can take all of them even easier then. How come the world is in crisis?
The main demon is admittedly stronger, but a punch from Superman will send him back to hell in an instant. Also, why did the whole world become nervous from this incident? Did they forget the existence of Justice League? Oh wait, why did our old magician contact and free Dwayne John instead of contacting Superman?
Bad bad movie."
BLACK ADAM,"So disappointed, silly jokes, bad child acting I have no idea how this was so bad. From the start the CGI and terrible kid voice over made me want to turn it off. The kid acting was unfortunately so bad, it sounds like he was reading script from flashcards and his character is really annoying. Why do they have to do that with kid characters, making them talk non stop, quipping every second, reckless, a liability every step, getting ppl killed, laughing and smiling as ppl are killed, showing no normal reaction to something crazy and scary!?? Why can't these movies make normal human characters.
Jokes were childlike and not smooth at all. CGI was too much. No explanation on who the characters really are and why we should care at all. Uhhhhhhhggghh I'm literally writing this review as I'm watching because I'm so bored."
BLACK ADAM,Worst movie of the year. 
BLACK ADAM,"Very bad. Don't go and watch this! Please safe your time, money, and your thoughts. This was so bad. Talk about cheesy. The story line was bland, the CGI was horrible, and the acting was terrible. Nothing felt epic. I look to my left and my brother is knocked out, I look back to the movie and find my self dozing off to how bored I was. Luckily I had the best chicken tenders from cinema cafe, so I wasn't to mad. Until I finished them and it felt like the movie would never end. But on a serious note, a lot of movies now a days is feeling like there is thought, effort, or time put into these movies. They just throw well known actors in there and get money. Not ok."
BLACK ADAM,Script written by school childrens 
BLACK ADAM,"Our audience is getting stupider by the minute Cartoons are fun. Stupid cartoons with horrible characters, baaaad cgi, tekken villains are plain stupid. People can enjoy whatever they want but we need to rate things accordingly. Wake up audience, let good things come to cinema and not just stupid cash grabs please.
If we don't appreciate things the way they are nothing good will happen. This movie is just overwhelmingly storyless action, watch it at home and don't pay attention to it but don't rate it any higher than what it is. They are stupidly force marketing the movie and think they can fool audience (which is really happening). I hope you understand what needs to be done."
BLACK ADAM,"Stopped watching after 5 minutes three diff times The worst movie I have ever seen!
Seriously, this is movie has serious flaws. Is that a cartoon in the beginning?
The makers of this movie had to be pretty dumb to think they could pull something like this off. They deserve to lose every cent invested.
I got madder and madder after every five minute session. I have never had this bad of a reaction to a movie. I'm not alone I think. I see many other negative reviews as well. Life is too short for Black Adam bs.
The constant narrative is, quite simply, too much. If you need to watch something, I suggest reruns of Nanny or George Lopez but definitely not Black Adam!"
BLACK ADAM,"Very bad movie. I don't like crapping all over art pieces. And movies are a form of art. But nowadays movie producers think that a massive budget is enough. Imagine what someone with a real vision could've done even with 1/10th of the budget ""black adam"" had. The movie started ok, I wanted to see more. But after the first fight scene, the movie turned into one big explosion. It was repetitive, shallow, and extremely boring. Obviously, a normal person can't produce such a movie. The cgi itself costs a fortune. But I just think to myself what I would've done with such a massive budget. How can a fast pace movie without a plot be so successful?.. No idea.."
BLACK ADAM,"Dwayne Makes it Lame I was forced to go watch this because of my family. Every movie with the rock is the same. Terrible acting and predictable. Plot is ridiculous and boring. Action scenes are bland. Thank God Marvel didn't sign him, otherwise he'd never go away. I really hope DC understands they don't need to keep going with crap like this. Dwayne can never make a movie good. There are millions of people that are so tired of Dwayne. He's reached a point in his life where he needs to retire and go away. He's like a cockroach. He's in everything. Bring back Superman or something. Hire new faces and actors. Give us something new!"
BLACK ADAM,I'm sorry they did this to you Dwayne... 
GODZILLA VS. KONG,Good job on ruining the series 
GODZILLA VS. KONG,"Waste of time, money and effort "
GODZILLA VS. KONG,"Kong deserves far more than this Withoubt doubt this has to be the worst Kong film ever made. The story-line was nonsense, the acting was just awful, and the ""connection"" between Kong and the lovely little deaf and mute girl was pure saccharine too sickly to stomach."
GODZILLA VS. KONG,"Rain, roars and retro lights "
GODZILLA VS. KONG,"Can't get much worse! A terrible movie from beginning to end, and this is why I don't go see movies in theaters anymore. All computerized graphics and that's about it. It actually gave a headache. Two thumbs down!"
GODZILLA VS. KONG,"It Is Criminal That Anyone Actually Spent Money Making This Schlock This picture is inconceivably bad in so many ways, I wouldn't know where to begin to describe its faults.
If I could give this movie a negative number, it would be somewhere in the minus 100s, perhaps lower.
My favorite line, I believe I am quoting it correctly, is ' Members of the Lost Party were never seen again....'
Watch this brain numbing turkey at your own peril, and remember you could have done something more productive, such as counting the individual squares of tissue in you favorite roll of toilet paper."
GODZILLA VS. KONG,Terrible! Can't believe I wasted 2 hours of my pathetic life for this garbage.
GODZILLA VS. KONG,"Brawndo the thirst mutilator. It's got electrolytes! As a society we've now truly become a case of life imitating art. We're living in an Idiocracy. That's what Godzilla v Kong represents. Empty calories for the masses. No nutrients for the grey matter. You don't need brains to enjoy this movie. In fact it helps if you're zombies.
Forget the most important aspect of a movie which is a plot. Who needs a plot when you've got hundreds of millions of dollars of CGI on the screen. All those zeros, ones and green screens convincing brain dead viewers that this kind of crap being pumped out by Warner Brothers and other studios is worth your time and money. Does anyone recall a time when movies were actually good? When the plot was actually worth following? Then again, who needs something as trivial as an engaging plot when you're got a giant ape and a giant lizard beating seven bells out of one another as you slurp down your Brawndo?
So keep handing over your money to these clueless studios and they'll happily keep churning out crap like Godzilla v Kong for you to gorge on. Or you can vote with your feet and your wallets and ensure that studios up their game. That moviemaker create protagonists that you can root for, villains whose motivations you can understand, characters that you can empathise with, go on a journey with....
Or you can choose not to in which case enjoy your Brawndo, and movie studios will continue to mutilate your thirst for mediocre CGI crapfests like Godzilla v Kong.
Just remember, ""It's got electrolytes!"""
GODZILLA VS. KONG,"Is cinematography dead? Has all movie making creativity simply disappeared? Who educates these writers and who hires them? Are they a dime a dozen? Is that the formula now - CGI and ginormic things with completely sterile story telling and character dynamics? Do we not even care about meaningful, even decent, flow? Or is it OK to just pile sequences on without any meaningful connection? How is this a 6 on IMDb? Who are the critics? Do they actually know anything or do they just happily work for this new industry based on movie making art that slowly died with the turn of the century?
I miss you, Ebert. I miss the time when critics had courage to say it like it is and when audiences actually listened, or cared about the art of movie making."
GODZILLA VS. KONG,CGI trash. The film equivalent of a gum wrapper put through the laundry. Millions of dollars spent on effects that are simply loud and obnoxious. The story is NOT science fiction. It is meaningless technobabble. I like some actual SCIENCE with my science fiction. Grims fairy tales make more scientific sense.
GODZILLA VS. KONG,Ridiculous 
GODZILLA VS. KONG,I didn't like the movie. It's an Abuse of science fiction. Has a terrible plot 
GODZILLA VS. KONG,"What did I just watch? What the hell was that? The CGI was incredible but the ""story"" made no sense whatsoever. Would highly recommend... To someone I dislike."
GODZILLA VS. KONG,Sucked 
GODZILLA VS. KONG,"Giant crap This is the clearest evidence of how Hollywood can destroy great movie icons. Unable to make a decent film about Godzilla, they decided to destroy the two great cinema monsters with the bonus that Mechagodzilla's fantastic robot is reduced to a cockscrew. If I pay a ticket to see the film I want the story to be honored: Godzilla has features that we hope to see film after film. I don't ask for much. But the untalented people who made the film came up with the idea that it was better not to play Godzilla's music. I thought of Star Wars without it´s iconic music. It's the same. An aberration. On the other hand, the humanization of King Kong is unbearable. Uncomfortable, worried, it makes it nauseating to see the great King Kong turned smart gorilla who can communicate with his little friend. Since when did King Kong stop liking blondes? The humans who star in the plot are also unbearable. The boy, the particular reason I hated Deadpool 2 now achieved the impossible: that he hated American movies about monsters with an inclusive cast. Of the others only one sentence: I wanted them all dead in the first frame. Everyone, their parents and their grandparents. I wanted everything to explode in the film, and in the final fight they would wipe out humanity, starting especially with those involved with the production of this slug, this crap, this cinematographic insult. Finally: Godzilla has no neck and has a microcephalic head. I don't know who came up with it that this is how the king of monsters should look. Godzilla for that anatomy couldn't even look to the side without having to rotate the body. King Kong using weapons is as if it were an extension of past films with apes conquering the world inaugurated by Charlton Heston. No Hollywood, don't do it anymore. Stop doing garbage. Stop insulting our intelligence and pockets. Stay away from this movie at all costs, well-shot fights aren't worth everything behind and around them. If you want to watch a decent movie, just watch the ones made in Japan or Pacific Rim."
GODZILLA VS. KONG,"Worse than you could possibly imagine. When I was young, I love the Jessica Lang and Jeff Bridges version of King Kong. When I was younger than that I loved the black and white version. I found passion and aliveness in these movies. I was delighted when Peter Jackson made his version and more so when they turned it into a 60's Vietnam era affair with Samuel Jackson. I even happily got through the Bryan Cranston version. But this despicable piece of celluloid trash makes nearly every mistake that a good movie embraces. It is insipid, disorganized, and patched together piecemeal in a way that makes it impossible for the actors to have any hope of creating realistic dialogue or a meaningful cohesive that guides to the end. It is the opposite of anything resembling feeling, and it would have been better for all involved to chop it up into tiny segments that the viewer could only see moments in time. It is an affront to anything Kong or Godzilla. The Matthew Broderick version, as pale and lusterless as it was, is far preferable than torturing you into seeing this version. Sometimes racism is so starkly presented, so obviously out there in the moment, that Black people, at least initially, are not outraged. They say to themselves, ""Wow. Wow, now that was racist,"" the sentiment being more of profound wonderment than anger. This is how it is with this movie. We cannot fathom how it could be this bad, and overcharged with the profundity of awfulness, we too also say, ""wow, I can't believe how bad this movie was."" I knew it would be so and was only enticed into renting when Redbox told me, after ordering, ""The Marksman,"" that this one would be half price. Perhaps the only redeeming factor is by default. The first Godzilla movies were cheap beyond comprehension. This one is the same, only they try to trick the viewer into believing that the subpar CGI is something much more than the Japanese originals. Nice payday Rebecca Marie Hall, who wishes she could be Sarah Polly or Emily Blunt. I am sure they paid her tons of money, but what is the cost of a soul?"
GODZILLA VS. KONG,"Martha, my mother's name is Martha! Full of plot holes, poor character development, mambo jumbo technology (seriously, they emailed energy source!) and 30 minutes fight scene."
GODZILLA VS. KONG,"Insulting to both Godzilla and Kong The movie is a result of what happens when you give writing and directing powers to an eight years old kid under the influence of hallucinogens.
No plot at all, kids saving the day, habitat in the core of the planet, giant monsters. Giant robot monsters, etc etc.
It's a disgrace to both legacies of Godzilla and Kong.
The only more ridiculous than the movie are the good ratings."
GODZILLA VS. KONG,"There is no monsterverse That really is just a lazy marketing ploy .
King Kong movies are about adventure and discovery, Godzilla flicks are about gimmecky lizards with lazer beams attached to their heads - if you get my drift .
Kong has never been a 'monster', Godzilla has never been anything but .
This film is reducing the intricate Heart of Darkness nature of the better Kong movies to the mostly cheap B-movie style of the Godzilla offerings .
Why can't there be both, the elaborate story telling of King Kong (2005) and even Skull Island, and the neon coloured world of Godzilla for the less demanding ?
Mid level marketing execs meetings - that's why we can't have nice things ."
GODZILLA VS. KONG,"What plot? My brother wanted to watch this movie when it first came out, and boy was he excited to finally watch it after a few months. At first glance, this movie seems enjoyable and even entertaining, but once you get about 10 minutes into the movie, you find out that is not the case. The plot? Not existent. The characters? Pretty unlikeable. It surprised me that the movie was so bad, since many hit stars like Millie Bobby Brown are in it. There are too many plots going on at the same time, which makes it very confusing. How on earth did they get from Florida to Hong Kong by going through a door? I wanted to turn it off after a while, but was determined to finish the movie out of spite. One good thing about the movie is that the CGI and editing is amazing and very realistic. The acting is good as well, but that's about it. All in all, this movie is not worth watching and will waste 1 hour and 53 minutes of you life. <3."
GODZILLA VS. KONG,WW 84 had nothing on the King of Bad! 
GODZILLA VS. KONG,"An insult to anyone with double digit intelligence! Its just absolutely inane, preposterous, uninspired, OTT nonsense with its specious bare bones story just an excuse to have two CGI leviathans battle it out!
Utter, utter crap imo!"
GODZILLA VS. KONG,Exceptionally painful to sit through... I desperately try to give movies a chance. I even try to give campy movies some consideration in perspective. But this movie was tortuous. With so much material to work with...the writers seemed to not care at all about the audience and seemed to write two separate scripts then smash them together at the end. I had no idea what the point was for most of the movie...when it even tried to have one. To point out the vast absurdities in the film would almost bait you to watch it out of curiosity. My wife and 8 year old son both fell asleep because nothing made sense. You are going to watch it...it is the only new thing since COVID. But if this was a normal year of blockbusters this would not get a nod.
GODZILLA VS. KONG,"It's so simple.... just show us monsters fighting.... How can you call the movie Godzilla vs Kong when there only like 30 minutes of fighting. There's an insane amount of characters for a monster movie. Plot sucks, strange attempts at comedy, and they still haven't explained how Godzilla stands in the middle of the ocean!"
GODZILLA VS. KONG,bad!!!! King Kong should've been dead by now. Why am I watching a nuclear lizard spend his time with a stupid ape. I hate this.
THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER,"Very very disappointed I'm a huge marvel fanboy, and hardly ever have anything bad to say to about the MCU, but this was a huge letdown. Ragnarok is easily one of my top 5 marvel films , so was very excited to see this one, but this was really really bad. It was boring as hell and none of the jokes landed for me. First time in a marvel movie I really wanted to leave or wished it would end already. Huge waste of Gorr the god butcher. And the whole Zeus and Olympus part were so cringe worthy. I don't know how this got made. It was garbage."
THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER,"Why is Disney ruining everything? Disney is a machine that catch good movies transform in trash food movies.
Thor is now a movie for children under 12 years.
Instead Thor as hero, Thor is a Teddy bear.
It is a shame."
THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER,"Parody This movie was a real parody. As a fan of Marvel movies, and a fan of Thor, this was the weakest movie that they have made. It was a real parody with the worst dialogs I have ever seen and heard. This was a movie for a 10 year old, maybe."
THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER,Thor: Bore and Blunder. 
THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER,"Korg had a mom, now he has two dads. "
THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER,Beyond disappointed... That was such a disappointment... I'm huge MCU fan but this ... was just a joke. Some parody of Thor. Cannot not and shouldn't be compared to other Thor movies!
THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER,"Crash Of A Franchise Marvel films have never been for a smart audience. But turning a character like Thor and many others into a Clash Of The Titans rom-com really seals the fate of this incarnation of the MCU. There really is nothing new here save for Thors butt, which nobody ever asked for. But serves to show just how low Marvel will go for toilet humor."
THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER,MCU please make a serious movie.... Please marvel stop making films for 12 years old....mcu fans who are there from iron man are now adults please make a good serious movie not just 2 years old's comedy.
THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER,"What Happened Guys? Huge disappointment!! This is a three star movie at best but it gets 1 from me as a result of the huge dissapointment delivered after a long period of high expectation...
The film makers/writers have fallen into that ghastly trap of squeezing out any old turgid nonsense onto celluloid just to make a big buck for marvel/disney... where is their self-respect? How could they denigrate everything they did in Ragnorok by producing ths horribly boring, unfunny and life draining chocolate log of a film....
It was supposed to be a summer block-buster... I'm glad I wached an illegal download because I'd have been furious to waste almost £40 taking the kids to see this....
They'd have ended up running up and down the isles out of sheer boredom...
such a crying shame."
THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER,They destroyed Thor 
THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER,"Where's the story ? The whole movie was full of quirky fantasy land buck rogers style context. And you should never blend Nordic and Greek gods / religions themes. Do your research before you even attempt that.
Just disappointing, Thor is and Avenger the movie fails at upholding that."
THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER,what did I just watch? 
THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER,Worst marvel of all time. 
THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER,Totally disappointed. 
THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER,"Empty. Annoying. String of jokes and gags. Bland fight sequences. Hollow characters. Candypop colours and bling. Lazy, formulaic BGM. Pointless, absolutely unnecessary. When did Marvel become a spoof of its own material? Even The Powerpuff Girls had more sincerity than Love and Thunder. Waited for two hours to feel SOMETHING. All I felt was a headache and a pair of tired eyes."
THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER,"Overall bad Bale, Hemsworth and Portman put up good performances but the rest of the movie was terrible. This is worst MCU movie to date, hands down. To much silliness and not enough actual effort in the script and directing."
THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER,"Ad if they wrote it within 5 mins on the toilet If you want to see how a movie with good actors and a good background story could be messed up, check this movie definitely out! It was an absolute waste of time. Written like a comedy, no seriousness throughout the entirety... Super happy ending as expected. Disgusting."
THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER,I thought I was watching a Thor parody. Struggled to find a serious moment. It had nonsensical jokes. Only saving part was Christian Bale's acting in Shadow realm. The story could have been a lot better.
THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER,"Taika is destroying Marvel Terrible Terrible movie. The plot holes and lack of consistency with the characters and timeline is shocking. It looks like all Taika is good for (apart from repeatedly flashing his name every other line in the end credits) is satire. And yes, it's funny in part, but we're not laughing with you Marvel studios; We're laughing at you as the credibility of all your offerings is disembowelled one character at a time by self grandiosed charlatans like Taika Wahiti. Such a shame. Generations of comic book heroes destroyed by an unthinking egopath."
THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER,"Billy Maguire It's so stupid movie, I regret watching this movie. It's a very stupid movie. I regret watching this movie. I advise you not to waste your precious time on this stupid movie."
THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER,It's awful I left after an hour.....and only cause I fell asleep......absolute pile of trash. Do not waste your time.....watching the washing machine is more funny.
THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER,"Cheap comedy It like a cheap comedy redo of a popular film.
Dont waste your money on it. Misuse of good actors. The last thor movie was really good, this is a disappointment The script is full of cheap comedy . I am Sad to see russel crow and Christian bale in such bad script."
THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER,"Boring and unfunny traded tickets for Black Phone Wow as a HUGE! Marvel fan I'm shocked at how bad this was. So many cliché jokes, no character development, and Chris Hemsworth is no longer an actor in my opinion but a Disney prop just generating revenue with the same old schtick. I personally think Disney buys reviews because how these disasters just debut with higher rating and falter when us fans speak our mind is shocking. Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn't have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren't even funny, it's like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them. Films don't care about good storytelling anymore, they want to be ""politically correct"" and enlighten us with how they want us to think. All hogwash. Save your money. Disney is 3rd rate."
THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER,"Disrespectful to Stan There's no question that Disney or one of its affiliates paid for this films 7/10 rating, and in spite of the countless negative reviews, that rating hasn't changed. This film is atrocious, and an intentional insult to Stan Lee and his legacy. It's literally the equivalent of drawing a mustache on the Mona Lisa because ""someone"" thinks it's ""funny"". Film, like all art, is forever, and permant contribution to our culture. Pity Disney didn't consider that prior to releasing this."
THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER,Extremely dissapointed 
UNCHARTED,"Disappointing Dialogues were outrageously cheesy and poorly written. Rafe Lee Judkins, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway need to pack their bags and leave Hollywood ASAP, maybe they can invite Ruben Fleischer too.
Tom Holland in his Peter Parker era. It's the same performance, nothing unique or original.
Just like Fleischer's previous films, this too muddled in questionable performances and lack of character development and it seems like they didn't held an audition for the supporting cast, studio executives just picked some random actors from nowhere. None of the cast members had any kind of chemistry or acting prowess to be in a $120 million production.
I don't know if its an inside joke or an accidental coincidence, there's literally a dialogue from Sully that says ""Wow, I'm really losing my touch"".
Marky Mark in his Bruce Willis era."
UNCHARTED,"One of the worst films I have seen. It truly was terrible. Two good lead actors with no chemistry. Some of the silliest scenes in any movie, it was very childish and yet felt it was aimed at adults. I certainly don't think anyone over 12 could enjoy it. Do not listen to indiana jones comparisons, it was more of a far fetched version of the Goonies but without the storyline or characters. Avoid at all costs."
UNCHARTED,"Doomed Raiders of the Missing Spark... There's nothing to see here that is fun, turn away, lock the door, make a run; the CGI's poor, acting's amateur, all threads have frayed apart, become unspun.
... and to think this might only be part 1!"
UNCHARTED,"Bad Makes ""National Treasure"" look like a masterpiece. Perhaps there were good action sequences: I wouldn't know because I walked out while they were still in Barcelona. Inane plot. Stupid dialogue. Phony performances. What an utter waste of time and resources."
UNCHARTED,"Flavourless movie Unlike the uncharted games this movie was off by literally everything , storyline , characters , acting & jokes It had no life and the actors put no effort into it.
The movie was so disappointing I wish they'd just left the games the way it is and not made this lazy movie with bad casting."
UNCHARTED,"This movie is an insult. I walked out of the cinema after about 30 minutes. I didn't get my money back but who cares. ""Uncharted"" is a literal insult to Naughtydog, their fans and most of all, Nolan North. Tom Holland is NOT Nathan Drake. He's not even a fanfiction version of him. There is no resemblance in either appearance NOR personality. And whoever made the decision to cast Mark-can't-act-Wahlberg as Sully needs to be banned from the entire industry."
UNCHARTED,"Dirty money This film supports ""cow tongue line"", which means that the film is really bad, so they just want to raise the sales from China. Supporting the wrong things is never accepted. Earning dirty money is what they did. Who make this film will never be forgiven."
UNCHARTED,"Totally trash I was enjoying the film but when I noticed that the nine-dash line was ""silently"" set in the maps of the film. Some kind of politics brainwash by the chinese government. As they have completed brainwash approx. 2B chinese people, now they are tryna wash the whole world's brain. Film is supposed for entertainment, not for politics."
UNCHARTED,"Let's play a game: Ask yourself, ""Can it get any worse?"" "
UNCHARTED,"Don't waste your time watching, play the game instead. When the announcement came of the film based on the game I was really looking forward to it, that was until I saw the cast list. Spiderman needs to stay being a kid in his Spdiyverse, because he can't act for shíte. Mark Wahlberg is completely the wrong actor to play Sully(Daniel Craig would have been a good choice). The choice of the leading ladies was good and to be honest Sophia Ali as Chloe Frazer outshines them all. Nice cameo from Antonio Banderas, but that is where any sort of praise for this film ends.
Lame plot, very poor acting, could possibly been helped with some comedic moments."
UNCHARTED,Unfounded Who is Tom Holland? Is he my neighbor's son next door? Is he one of the kids passing by my house after school everyday? How did he become Nathan Drake in the great action game Uncharted? Is that an illusion?
UNCHARTED,"Never Walked Out Of A Movie Before I have seen many movies that are terrible but usually there is something that can keep me engaged enough to not leave the theater. Uncharted unfortunately was that bad. About an hour and twenty five minutes in I said enough is enough. From the ridiculous script to the super wooden acting, everything fell completely flat right out of the gate. The humor is very cringey and gets old fast along with the action sequences. Take my advice and spend your money elsewhere."
UNCHARTED,"Mark Walberg is a man-baby. One of the worst things I have ever seen. Mark 'Tiny Man' Walberg does his bland, Boston man performance which has been seen too many times before. A similar effort is put in by Holland who does a generic action hero act that appears in all basic and tedious movies.
Get rid of all of this and give up on video game movies. They will never work. Mark Walberg will never work. Get rid of him first though. Priorities.
I'm pretty sure that actually I just cannot stand Marky Mark. Bias much?
Yes."
UNCHARTED,"Movie is horrible. Unless you're taking your kids, you can miss this one. I am writing. This review while sitting in the movie. It is terrible. I've been bored since it started. Opening scene has the worst CGI I have ever seen in a movie."
UNCHARTED,"Testosterone Banter: The Movie Does this review contain spoilers? Nope, nothing could spoil 1.5 hours more than this.
Imagine how bad a movie could be if the wet dream of some 13-yr-old with ADHD is given a multimillion budget & unlimited access to CGI.
Then think a bit worse."
UNCHARTED,Hollywood is populated with children. 
UNCHARTED,"Nathan Drake the baby faced Manlet I don't mean to sound toxic masculine, but I will. Tom Holland is a skinny beta male soyboy and he is not nathan drake. He's nothing like Nathan from the games. Some people are just never made for certain roles and here is a prime example of hollywood putting big names over lore."
UNCHARTED,Any Review Above 1 Is A Lie This has to be one of the most embarrassing video game adaptations ever that does no justice for Uncharted. Tom Holland and Mark Burgers are terrible actors and should have never been casted in this film. Anyone who says it's good clearly never played the games and do not have good taste in cinema.
UNCHARTED,"An insult to the game I understand wanting name value, but to sacrifice a video game series for talentless actors is pathetic. It's unfair to the actual actors of the game and the devs that worked years to make such successful video game franchise. Please stop ruining games. Hollywood should create their own ideas and original concepts instead of ripping-off video games."
UNCHARTED,"Uninteresting One of the worst movies in the past 10 years. Miscast, ok action and a very weak script make this a film I highly suggest you look the other way on. What were they thinking casting Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg as the leads? Heck, I would've accepted Morgan Freeman as Sully and Channing Tatum as Drake. This is an obvious cash grab at it's worst. Hopefully it flops so any future sequels are cancelled."
UNCHARTED,Watch the 15 min short instead and save your hard earned15 dollers Gut wrenching movie Nathan looks nothing like Tom baby face Holland even when he is older he wont. Also Mark Wahlberg is miscast here . Save your money for a better causes.
UNCHARTED,"Just curious Who said Tom is a good actor or, at the very least, a charismatic person? Especially for an adventurous movie, come on! Is he the best who can be suggested by this generation? No one who would be even a little closer to Harrison Ford, for example? Of course, there are such young people, but somehow specifically Tom was made a generation icon in modern cinematic entertainment. Poor kids. We had much brighter screen heroes, than this glum toneless boy. Looks like a big miscast. Like Adam Driver in shameless Star Wars reboot."
UNCHARTED,Movies just aren't good anymore This movie was terrible. Dialogue was boring and uninspired. A lot of scenes/decisions didn't make sense (ex. How is the helicopter pilot the guy who was originally on the ground). Mark Whalburg plays the same guy in every movie at this point. He is so unfunny and played out. Tom Holland was the only part of this worth watching. He is a great actor even though the dialogue for his character was terrible too.
UNCHARTED,"So bad and childish, it's sad. Like a lot of movies these days, this is very, very bad. Could be interesting for a child who hasn't seen much maybe, but for an adult, this is bad in every way. A sad, poorly executed childish wannabe kids movie. Don't waste your time on this one..."
UNCHARTED,So very disappointed Waste of time! Tom and Mark were so lame in their roles and way too similar acting. They ruined the chemistry of the video game because these two actors have ZERO chemistry. Both are terribly miscast. The film goes on and on and you lose interest about 30 minutes in. Every action film cliche' and very little originality. THIS FILM SUCKED.
